## ML Model Logs
Please refer to this Google Doc [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbVSwV-hOVDH6KOhZyQZVdEpqOnWA63lkSm7FQlKa70/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbVSwV-hOVDH6KOhZyQZVdEpqOnWA63lkSm7FQlKa70/edit) for current model performance.

## Note
The feature engineering and ML model files are in the ``pipeline/scripts`` directory. The pickled data
files are in ``pipeline/pickles``. Note that the pickle files are separated based on the type of features 
so that it's easier to try experimenting with and combining different features during ML training.
