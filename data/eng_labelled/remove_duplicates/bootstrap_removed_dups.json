(The browser is not too big, and not too small, the contents can fit well within dimensions without feeling cluttered or crammed, and great for multi-tasking). \r\n\r\nMy problem and reasoning is the following: \r\n\r\n- All website running bootstrap that are snapped to half screen at that resolution, take on the appearance of a tablet or mobile layout. \r\n  - Burger Stack Navigation UI \r\n  - Menus hidden behind left or top collapse (burger stack)\r\n  - Oversized UI (feels like websites are zoomed-in by default)\r\n  - Grids only display a column of 1 (instead of 3+)\r\n  - Unutilized and super exaggerated side margins (because the screen is big, and columns are small)\r\n- Every website i visit, i have to drop zoom between 90% and 75% because designers use \"small\" (sometimes \"medium\") for mobile layouts. \r\n  - Sometimes that's a difficult balance, between mobile UI on desktop, and font text too small to read.\r\n  \r\n...I had some more issues to present, but i lost track of what they were while typing. Might re-edit if there's still a need to continue on...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15901670/107629549-47935500-6c30-11eb-9226-39b35b833b76.png)\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution:\r\n\r\n- Change the threshold numbers from ~970 to maybe ~940 (if i zoom-out, 941 goes to 1045 @ 90%)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15901670/107630305-4f072e00-6c31-11eb-866b-6d21434daa91.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15901670/107629829-ac4eaf80-6c30-11eb-87f5-20d279a0eaf4.png)\r\n\r\n",

The usual approach that, as an author, I'd expect is:\r\n\r\n- carousel is static by default\r\n- authors can explicitly opt into autoplaying at page load somehow (e.g. adding some sort of autoplay toggle, like `data-bs-autoplay`, defaulted to `false`, but authors can set it explicitly to `true` to opt-in)\r\n- for autoplaying carousels, stop the autoplay after an interaction (i.e. the user has explicitly clicked somewhere, moved focus into the carousel, is hovering over it) by default (this respects the user's intent by default)\r\n- allow authors to explicitly ignore users hovering over the carousel with the mouse (but don't do it for keyboard) - with added warning that the option should not be used for any kind of interactive slide content, as that will otherwise move the content from under the users' mouse pointer/feet. for this reason, don't offer this option for keyboard/focus, as there it would be even more annoying and potentially lead to focus being lost/reset to the start of the page. maybe call it `data-bs-hoverstop`, which defaults to `true`, but can be suppressed with `false`\r\n\r\nadmittedly this would now be a breaking change, but i think a change for the better.\r\n",

Leading to faster feedback cycle)\r\nEasier for beginners to understand (No more division with 12!!! )\r\nLesser Code through use of Grid \r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nBootstrap could provide us with Grid System which will really be a much-needed act.\r\n\r\n# Demo Source\r\nLive Link: https://bootstrap-grid.vercel.app/\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" sizes=\"32x32\" href=\"./images/favicon-32x32.png\">\r\n    <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@600&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.2/css/all.css\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-vSIIfh2YWi9wW0r9iZe7RJPrKwp6bG+s9QZMoITbCckVJqGCCRhc+ccxNcdpHuYu\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\r\n    <title>Frontend Mentor | Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks</title>\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n        .card {\r\n            height: 250px;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        .g-1 {\r\n            grid-template-columns: 1fr;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        @media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n\r\n\r\n            .g-md-2 {\r\n                grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @media (min-width: 992px) {\r\n\r\n            .g-lg-4 {\r\n                grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    </style>\r\n\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n    <h1 class=\"text-center\">Flexbox</h1>\r\n    <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"card  col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card  col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card  col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card  col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <h1 class=\"text-center\">Grid</h1>\r\n    \r\n    <div style=\"display: grid;\" class=\" g-lg-4 g-md-2 g-1 \">\r\n        <div class=\"card\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"card\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nDemo Source Code\r\nDemo Image\r\n",

My monitor resolution is 1920x1080; on a Windows OS (7 and higher) you can snap browsers and application windows to fit screen display. When monitor and resolution are at that size, it's [visually] comfortable to stack two browser windows side-by-side, dividing screen size in half, and each fill up both halves. (The browser is not too big, and not too small, the contents can fit well within dimensions without feeling cluttered or crammed, and great for multi-tasking). \r\n\r\nMy problem and reasoning is the following: \r\n\r\n- All website running bootstrap that are snapped to half screen at that resolution, take on the appearance of a tablet or mobile layout. \r\n  - Burger Stack Navigation UI \r\n  - Menus hidden behind left or top collapse (burger stack)\r\n  - Oversized UI (feels like websites are zoomed-in by default)\r\n  - Grids only display a column of 1 (instead of 3+)\r\n  - Unutilized and super exaggerated side margins (because the screen is big, and columns are small)\r\n- Every website i visit, i have to drop zoom between 90% and 75% because designers use \"small\" (sometimes \"medium\") for mobile layouts. \r\n  - Sometimes that's a difficult balance, between mobile UI on desktop, and font text too small to read.\r\n  \r\n...I had some more issues to present, but i lost track of what they were while typing.

The usual approach that, as an author, I'd expect is:\r\n\r\n- carousel is static by default\r\n- authors can explicitly opt into autoplaying at page load somehow (e.g. adding some sort of autoplay toggle, like `data-bs-autoplay`, defaulted to `false`, but authors can set it explicitly to `true` to opt-in)\r\n- for autoplaying carousels, stop the autoplay after an interaction (i.e. the user has explicitly clicked somewhere, moved focus into the carousel, is hovering over it) by default (this respects the user's intent by default)\r\n- allow authors to explicitly ignore users hovering over the carousel with the mouse (but don't do it for keyboard) - with added warning that the option should not be used for any kind of interactive slide content, as that will otherwise move the content from under the users' mouse pointer/feet. for this reason, don't offer this option for keyboard/focus, as there it would be even more annoying and potentially lead to focus being lost/reset to the start of the page. maybe call it `data-bs-hoverstop`, which defaults to `true`, but can be suppressed with `false`\r\n\r\nadmittedly this would now be a breaking change, but i think a change for the better.\r\n",

There is an enormous wow-factor missing, because developers can't leverage standardized `animate-*` directives.\r\n\r\n## Animation libraries with Bootstrap are sub-optimal\r\n\r\n- TailwindCSS  [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation) is offering - `animate-ping`, `animate-pulse`, `animate-spin`, and `animate-bounce`\r\n- Animate.css [https://animate.style](https://animate.style) has had animations for a few years - `animate-bounce`, `animate-flash`, `animate-pulse`, `animate-rubberBand`, `animate-shakeX`, `animate-shakeY`, `animate-headShake`, etc\r\n- React-Spring [https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/examples](https://animate.style) provides animation chains. And Bootstrap components (and sub-components) could have animation chains (see [https://codesandbox.io/embed/2v716k56pr](https://codesandbox.io/embed/2v716k56pr))\r\n\r\nSome might question \"Why not just use these libraries with Bootstrap?\", but for anyone that has spent time with these libraries - they aren't made for Bootstrap components - and getting these to work cleanly with Bootstrap requires a lot of customization. Essentially any work is an unofficial hack, because it can introduce glitches, and can become obsolete when the Bootstrap framework moves to the next version.\r\n\r\n## Bootstrap animations should be standardized\r\n\r\nI think that by default, all components should be given `animate-toggle` (or `a-toggle` for short), which is a simple show-hide animation. Currently, components use a mix of animations without standardization.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- Alerts with `alert-dismissible` should by default use `a-toggle` (not `a-fade`)\r\n- Carousel slides behave correctly, the default is `a-toggle` and the `a-slide` is needed for the slide animation. However, the controls should not be animated on hover without `a-hover-light`.\r\n- Collapse and Accordian should by default be `a-toggle` (not `a-slide-down`)\r\n- Checkboxes should be `a-toggle` (not `a-fade`)\r\n- List groups (tabbable panes), behave as expected (use `a-toggle` by default), but the buttons should use `a-hover-darken`\r\n- Models should not have fade or backdrop by default, unless given `a-fade-down`, `a-fade-up`, and the backdrop `a-fade`\r\n- Navs tabs behave as expected (use `a-toggle` by default)\r\n- Popover should be `a-toggle` (not `a-fade`)\r\n- Progress bar that is animated should be `a-bg-slide-left` (not `progress-bar-animated`)\r\n- Spinners should be `a-spin-right`, and `a-pulse`\r\n- Toasts, and Tooltips should be `a-toggle` (not `a-fade`)\r\n\r\nMore trivial examples:\r\n- Buttons and links should not change on hover without `a-hover-dark`, and `a-hover-underline`\r\n- Dropdown buttons and Inputs, should not outline without `a-outline`\r\n- Checkbox, Range, and Radio should not darken on click-down, unless given `a-darken` class\r\n\r\n## Also consider animation chains\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"first-element a-fade-in\">Good</span>\r\n<!-- this animation runs after the previous animation stops -->\r\n<span class=\"a-fade-in\" data-animate-after=\"first-element\">Morning</span>\r\n```",

When switching the page language, the value of this attribute will be switched. Of course, it will not be modified, and there will generally be no problems. . The design should be switched. Different language types should use different font files to display the corresponding content to conform to the reading visual habits of the corresponding people, rather than the same font style.\r\nIn the current Bootstrap design, this font-family is set on the body, and other child elements will inherit attributes. I think the font-family attribute should not be set in the body, but should be placed in the html tag. If there are other needs in the future, you can also set up different languages. In the body, when defining different font files in different languages, you need to set one more layer, as shown in the following example.\r\n\r\n\r\n```css\r\nhtml[lang^='zh-'] body {\r\n    font-family: \u5b8b\u4f53, serif;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe correct approach is that pages in different languages \u200b\u200buse different lang values.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOf course there are also :lang pseudo-elements.

        "body": "In v5, would there be a chance of cleaning up the size modifiers for `form-control`?\r\n\r\nI've never actually had to use small form controls before, until now because I'm working on some form-heavy pages with >50 fields, and wishing to make everything small. I've noticed a few little things that make it a tiny bit painful to work with.\r\n\r\nCurrently if I want a small text input it's `form-control form-control-sm` which makes sense, but is twice as much typing. If I want a form control I can specify `form-control`, and if I want a small form control I can specify `form-control-sm`. It's also a little confusing using the same type of convention as responsive breakpoints, so `form-control form-control-sm` might imply that `form-control-sm` does something at the `sm` breakpoint, which it doesn't. Maybe using specific terms like `form-control-small` would be easier to understand?\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control form-control-sm\" placeholder=\"Example\" />\r\n```\r\ncould become\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control-small\" placeholder=\"Example\" />\r\n<!--OR-->\r\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control small\" placeholder=\"Example\" />\r\n<!--OR-->\r\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control-sm\" placeholder=\"Example\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also be extended to what was once the `form-group` style, with a div surrounding a label and an input. You could specify `small` or something similar to the parent element and elements inside would use small sizing. This could become generic enough to perhaps be applied form-wide, say if I wanted my entire form to use small controls.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"mb-3 small\">\r\n  <label for=\"formGroupExampleInput\" class=\"form-label\">Example label</label>\r\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"formGroupExampleInput\" placeholder=\"Example input placeholder\">\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"small\">\r\n  <div class=\"mb-3\">\r\n    <label for=\"formGroupExampleInput\" class=\"form-label\">Example label</label>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"formGroupExampleInput\" placeholder=\"Example input placeholder\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"mb-3\">\r\n    <label for=\"formGroupExampleInput\" class=\"form-label\">Example label</label>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"formGroupExampleInput\" placeholder=\"Example input placeholder\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.small {\r\n  label,\r\n  input {\r\n    // small css properties\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor labels too there's no `form-label-sm` class you have to use `col-form-label-sm` which makes no sense because I should be able to use small labels outside column layout. Further to that `col-form-label-sm` requires no use of `form-label col-form-label-sm` like `form-control` does, making it inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert on scss or any of this, but just my suggestion as I've noticed it's a littly clunky.\r\n\r\nAs an ultimate extension to this, controlling global default control size would be great too through a scss variable. And even getting rid of the need for `form-control` alltogether using a scss variable would be cool too, because if I want to use bootstrap then unless I specifically need it why would I want default form UI. It could always still be available with a `default` class if it's specifically wanted. \r\n\r\nHope this all makes sense :smile:",

This way, we would have a \"Core\" SCSS and a \"Colors\" SCSS for each component of Bootstrap. Doing that would allow loading the Core CSS once and as many themes (Colors variants) as we want to.\r\n\r\n_The \"Core\" and \"Colors\" could also be divided into modules, as suggested in #28900. One idea does not block the other._\r\n\r\nThe Core should not contain any color (including shadows, outline, etc.), while the Colors should only contain instructions that color elements. The color themselves should remain variables (or one variables file per module, in case of modules), so we keep the same control as of now (using variables), with the possibility of more (theming).\r\n\r\nFor example, by applying this principle, we could generate one CSS that contains light and dark themes as easy as:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// Core\r\n@import \"functions\";\r\n@import \"mixins\";\r\n// ...\r\n@import \"forms-core\";\r\n@import \"buttons-core\";\r\n// ...\r\n// Light theme (colors)\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {\r\n    @import \"variables-light\";\r\n    // ...\r\n    @import \"forms-colors\";\r\n    @import \"buttons-colors\";\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n// Dark theme (colors)\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n    @import \"variables-dark\";\r\n    // ...\r\n    @import \"forms-colors\";\r\n    @import \"buttons-colors\";\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd even add a third \"theme\" like:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// A random theme (colors)\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: highcontrast) {\r\n    @import \"variables-highcontrast\";\r\n    // ...\r\n    @import \"forms-colors\";\r\n    @import \"buttons-colors\";\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_The use of `prefers-color-scheme` is optional and could be replaced by any other technique that is the most appropriate for each individual use-case. We could also split the CSS into multiple files and whatnot._\r\n\r\n> While at it, another thing that is hard to adjust is the inline modification of colors instead of using variables (like inlining `darken(...)` and other similar functions. It would be great not to have any of that anywhere as well \ud83d\ude09 \r\n\r\nBottom line: I think that by doing this, it would make it way easier for the community to create themes and for you in the future to maintain both a light and a dark theme.",

The `.active` class was never removed as it is only looking for children under the `.nav` div:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/js/src/tab.js#L137-L140\r\n\r\n```\r\n  _activate(element, container, callback) {\r\n    const activeElements = container && (container.nodeName === 'UL' || container.nodeName === 'OL')\r\n      ? $(container).find(SELECTOR_ACTIVE_UL)\r\n      : $(container).children(SELECTOR_ACTIVE)\r\n\r\n    ..\r\n\r\n    if (active && isTransitioning) {\r\n      const transitionDuration = Util.getTransitionDurationFromElement(active)\r\n\r\n      $(active)\r\n        .removeClass(CLASS_NAME_SHOW)\r\n        .one(Util.TRANSITION_END, complete)\r\n        .emulateTransitionEnd(transitionDuration)\r\n    } else {\r\n      complete()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I wonder if it would as simple to change:\r\n\r\n`$(container).children(SELECTOR_ACTIVE)`\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n`$(container).find(SELECTOR_ACTIVE)`\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to be able to navigate tabbed tabbed content with other Bootstrap controls like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nBug reports must include:\r\n\r\n- Operating system and version: macOS 10.15.5\r\n- Browser and version: Chrome 83.0.4103.116\r\n- Test case: https://jsfiddle.net/marceloverdijk/5eznyvua/\r\n",

Should work in [all supported browsers](https://twbs-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/5.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/), meaning Edge Legacy and Safari 10 for the oldest.\r\n2. Should work seamlessly with all our components and utilities.\r\n3. Should be tested, probably with new examples templates.\r\n4. Should be maintainable, thus not lay on hacky things.\r\n\r\nAm I missing any pre-requisite, @twbs/team?\r\n\r\nFWIW, one of the best resource I ever read about RTL is very recent: [RTL Styling 101 by Ahmad Shadeed](https://www.rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling/).\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nLet me try to sum up the various ways to tackle this in v5.\r\n\r\n### Another `dist` file\r\n\r\nThis is what we used in [Boosted v4](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap), using [rtlcss](https://rtlcss.com).\r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n- another file, not a single bloated one\r\n- easy to setup\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n- some values have to be ignored, and rtlcss is not very pleasant to use with clunky CSS comments to flag things: https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives/#ignore\r\n- a few overrides were required in Boosted, mostly around `transform`s and inlined SVGs\r\n\r\n### Logical properties\r\n\r\nThey're meant to be **the** standard way to do. [However Edge Legacy doesn't support them](https://caniuse.com/#search=logical%20properties), so we're kinda stuck with this.\r\n\r\n[PostCSS-logical](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-logical) is meant to handle this in two ways:\r\n1. each logical property results in two new declarations, suffixed with `:dir()`\r\n2. each logical property only gets a LTR fallback: `text-align: left; text-align: start;`\r\n\r\nBoth of them will result in a bloated filesize, and the second\u2014despite being the ordinary fallback\u2014won't allow Edge Legacy to handle RTL.\r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n- future-proof\r\n- standardized and CSS-y\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n- Lack of support\r\n- Filesize (directly due to the lack of support)\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\n- [Adrian Roselli's post about logical properties](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html)\r\n- [Can I Use logical properties?](https://caniuse.com/#search=logical%20properties)\r\n- [Chen Hui Jing's \"CSS for internationalisation\"](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/css-for-i18n/)\r\n- [Andy Bell's Piccalilli's post about logical properties](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/css-logical-properties/)\r\n\r\n### Sassy way\r\n\r\nAs suggested in the most recent issue about RTL\u2014 #28797\u2014 a sassy way is possible.\r\n\r\nI'd be in favor of a simpler way to handle things: \r\n- using a mixin, **like we do for media queries**: `@include rtl()`\r\n- **checking for a boolean** before going ahead, like we do for shadows or rounded: `@if $enable-rtl {}`\r\n- then wrapping mixin content in `:dir(rtl)` using `@content`\r\n- and then, just use CSS.\r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n- Sass only\r\n- Consistent with our current way to do things\r\n- Can be `false` by default\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n- Requires that we write the RTL styles by ourselves\r\n- Source code bloat\r\n- A single bloated output when enabled\r\n\r\n## So\u2026\r\n\r\nMy CSS geekery would like to go with Logical properties; rtlcss seems simpler to me since I'm already used to it and it's a robust and proven solution; the sassy way looks a bit naive\u2026\r\n\r\n**I'd like to hear opinions and suggestions before trying something**.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\nThanks @ZaidBarghouthi for listing this!\r\n\r\n#28797 #28238 #24807 #27123 #27122 #26879 #26818 #19545 #26299 #25422 #24662 #23703 #24332 #23117 #22708 #22137 #21619 #21180 #20293 #19555 #20075 #19787 #19703 #19668 #19643 #19545 #19379 #18184 #17595 #16455 #16419 #15717 #15700 #15509 #15479 #15433 #14717 #14510 #13564",

As a note, there are a lot of supporting Google queries which make standard bootstrap carousel works as I want, but they a very complicated and not unique - you always need cheating solutions, need more code. \r\nI want to use usual `grid` and `flex` utilities to create the slider which you need. \r\nAt this moment I've dropped infinite loop at all, because I don't have tests which passing this option in usability. Those kind of elements usually come from _design_ and _common things for nowage web_. \r\n\r\n- No nav slider utils on mobile (nav is redundant when you have swipes). I want native browser swiping (because it's cheaper for fx). \r\n- I want easy and fast customisation with `html` only, because it's independent from other languages.\r\n \r\nAs the result, I came up to the following solution, and I want to discuss it (it has bugs).

Closed issues seem to suggest that the bootstrap team advocates for using anchor tags when something actually navigates or takes you to another page, while buttons should be used for all other actions. This fits well with accessibility since screen readers do treat anchors and buttons differently. Anchors can be styled as buttons using the `.btn` class, and buttons can be styled to be like links with `.btn-link`, so it seems that everything is covered. However, elements with `.btn` class don't line up well when placed next to other text as mentioned here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27515\r\n\r\nI've created my own .btn-link-inline in our customized bootstrap based around the referenced issue. Here is a screenshot of the issue it is trying to solve:\r\n\r\n![btn-link-inline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1603868/52370053-f7210580-2a1f-11e9-84e7-707565a16569.png)\r\n\r\nMy particular use case is a control that allows you to browse a tree. Nothing in this control links to another page. At the top are breadcrumbs allowing you to view parent folders in the tree (essentially go back). My inclination is to make these \"links\" buttons with `.btn-link`. Unfortunately, they don't align vertically at all with neighboring text, i.e. the divider. I can use a disabled button for the active folder but the divider is still an issue and making those disabled buttons as well makes no sense. I've tried adding p-0 border-0 and the like but they still don't line up well (an `.align-inherit` util is what is missing). What is the recommendation here?\r\n\r\n- implement custom styling for buttons that need to be rendered exactly like link text (this feels like it should be a bootstrap feature and I would be willing to create a PR)\r\n- go against accessibility standards and use anchor tags with void hrefs\r\n",

So I propose a solution to handle this case (but I don't have any skill in JS to do it and open MR).\r\n\r\n**Current process:**\r\nThe property `active` was removed from the current `carousel-item` and added to the next `carousel-item`. So we can imagine to add a value to know how many ative elements the carousel can display.\r\n\r\n**Concrete case:**\r\n```HTML\r\n<div id=\"carouselExampleSlidesOnly\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\" data-value=3>\r\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=777&fg=555&text=First slide\" alt=\"First slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=666&fg=444&text=Second slide\" alt=\"Second slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=555&fg=333&text=Third slide\" alt=\"Third slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=555&fg=333&text=Fourth slide\" alt=\"Fourth slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=555&fg=333&text=Fifth slide\" alt=\"Fifth slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\".../800x400?auto=yes&bg=555&fg=333&text=Sixth slide\" alt=\"Sixth slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JS take the value from `data-value` (or whatever the name is defined) and understand he have 3 (in the example) `active` property at the same time. So I remove the first `active` found and I add `active` to current element + 3.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can handle many new possibilities for the carousel.\r\n",

CSS variables can work in conjunction of SASS. \r\nI'm happy with a few the first couple of CSS variables in bootstrap, but as [already mentioned](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23349#issuecomment-346813716) they're only exposed and not used by bootstrap itself. This means, if a project likes to override these CSS variables at runtime, there's no effect with the bootstrap components themself. \r\n\r\nIs there anything against going into the CSS variable direction? [Browser support is really great](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables) and the fallback option will keep non-supported browsers happy. \r\n\r\nI understand this is a big change though. It woudl work like this:\r\n\r\nIntialize CSS vars. We use use double-double fallback to ensure we have a fallack and do not need to repeately add the fallback everywhere. \r\n```\r\n:root {\r\n    --primary: var(--primary-color, #{$primary});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen for each and every component that uses the primary color, we could use the --primary variable instead. For example on a button, it would go like this (just a few lines that i'm using in my sandbox project, so its not so relevant to bootstrap sources):\r\n```\r\n.btn {\r\n    &-primary {\r\n        background-color: var(--primary);\r\n        border-color: var(--primary);\r\n        &:hover,\r\n        &:not(:disabled):not(.disabled):active {\r\n            background-color: var(--primary-darken);\r\n            border-color: var(--primary-darken);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow to change the color at runtime. \r\n\r\n",

Zurb Foundation.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about Emails. Unlike Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation has the ability to create email-friendly markup using their CSS inliner and email templates, see this link => https://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html\r\n\r\n**I think this would certainly make a great feature to Bootstrap** and possibly attract another type of audience to Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nIt could take a while to potentially develop, but it could be worth releasing it in a beta stage similarly to how Bootstrap 4 was released in an Alpha stage. I've mocked up how we could potentially add this section to the Bootstrap site by including a 'Emails' link, making use of your badges to highlight that it's a beta feature, this would be great because it releases a new feature quicker so people can start using it and providing feedback!\r\n\r\n#### Current Navbar\r\n![bootstrap-nav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25177538/39961258-64a07f20-562a-11e8-8a54-f43f607455e0.PNG)\r\n\r\n#### Proposal mockup with Emails\r\n![bootstrap-nav-mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25177538/39961257-6487e32a-562a-11e8-9dc1-a969da79ff50.PNG)\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of this? I think emails are just as important these days for marketing and interacting with customers and generating leads! By implementing this you're essentially showing the Bootstrap brand to even more people because they could see your logo in emails that people generate.\r\n\r\n**Personally, I think this feature would be great to see! <3**\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please admins feel free to\r\nedit / ask for clarification is something doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nSo, as I understand it, bootstrap has some options for the use of\r\ntypography. Like $font-size-lg and $font-size-sm variables and\r\nthe `.small` and `<small />` tags. Also, there's the possibility to \r\nuse the `.h1 ... .h6` classes to change the font size of any element.\r\n\r\nStill I find that `lg` and `sm` font-sizes are insufficient for every\r\ncase. And even though the `.hX` could serve this purpose, they\r\nhave some inherent semantic sense that is inappropriate in many\r\ncases. The docs even intruct to use them: \r\n\r\n> for when you want to match the font styling of a heading, but\r\ncannot use the associated HTML element.\r\n\r\nIt'd be useful to have dedicated: `size-1` to `size-6` (or better name)\r\nthat are only supposed to modify the element's font size. These\r\nclasses would be dependent on a potential `$type-scale`  variable like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$type-scale: (\r\n  1:  2.5,\r\n  2:  2,\r\n  3:  1.75,\r\n  4:  1.5,\r\n  5:  1.25,\r\n  6:  1,\r\n  7:  .8,\r\n  8:  .7\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented with a function called `font-size($scale-number)`.\r\n\r\nI understand one of the counterpoints to this feature is that it can\r\nbe implemented with custom, per-project css, and it's true. But I\r\ncan see the benefit of having it by default in the framework. One\r\nway it could be extended is having another `line-height-for($scale-number)`\r\nfunction that calculates a line height that is a multiple of the base line\r\nspacing `($line-height-base * $font-size-base)`, as an example.\r\nSo `size-1` could, for example, apply:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfont-size: font-size(1);\r\nline-height: line-height-for(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that there's space for additional font sizes smaller than the\r\nbase, (7 & 8). This is more practic than having\r\n`$font-size-{sm/lg/base/smaller/larger/super-large}`.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the things why I'd like to see this implemented are:\r\n\r\n 1. Consistency / One source of truth. Font size units not  \r\n     scattered around / duplicated.\r\n 2. Versatility. `size-1` would allow developers to just modify the\r\n     sizing aspect of an element's typography. Leaving `.hX`\r\n     classes for proper title-replication.\r\n 3. Example value. By implementing a good-practice, well defined\r\n     type scale.\r\n 4. Extensibility. A couple of issues in the past were raised, in\r\n     my opinion partly, because of a lack of font related features.\r\n     Some of them: #24856 ,  #18137, #23119 . \r\n 5. Easy to implement.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your opinion, cheers!",

My use case is that I am using Angular 5 and have written a dropdown button component with the template being the following\r\n\r\nBelow is the template for component named `question-dropdown-button`\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"input-group-append\" ngbDropdown>\r\n  <button ngbDropdownToggle class=\"btn btn-outline-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Dropdown</button>\r\n  <div ngbDropdownMenu class=\"dropdown-menu\">\r\n    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Action</a>\r\n    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Another action</a>\r\n    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a>\r\n    <div role=\"separator\" class=\"dropdown-divider\"></div>\r\n    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Separated link</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then use this component anywhere that I need it, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"input-group\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" />\r\n  <question-dropdown-button></question-dropdown-button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen loading this does not apply the border radius correctly to the dropdown button even though this is in an `input-group-append`.  Looking at the generated CSS I believe this is down to the combinator that is used and relies on the `input-group-append` being a child of the `input-group` class.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Angular 5 and it's component rendering the following is the HTML output\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div _ngcontent-c12=\"\" class=\"input-group\">\r\n  <input _ngcontent-c12=\"\" class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\">\r\n  <question-dropdown-button _ngcontent-c12=\"\" _nghost-c13=\"\">\r\n    <div _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"input-group-append dropdown\" ngbdropdown=\"\">\r\n      <button _ngcontent-c13=\"\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" class=\"btn btn-outline-secondary dropdown-toggle dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" ngbdropdowntoggle=\"\" type=\"button\">Dropdown</button>\r\n      <div _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-menu\" ngbdropdownmenu=\"\">\r\n        <a _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Action</a>\r\n        <a _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Another action</a>\r\n        <a _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a>\r\n        <div _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-divider\" role=\"separator\"></div>\r\n        <a _ngcontent-c13=\"\" class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Separated link</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </question-dropdown-button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will notice the additional element that wraps the `input-group-append` element which means this is no longer a direct child of `input-group` and so \"breaks\" the combinator.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Hello fine folks of Bootstrap, today I wanted to discuss the potential of modifying the bootstrap source JS to support browser based imports natively, without any third party tools/transpilers or the like.\r\n\r\n## Preface\r\n\r\nAt the moment, all of [Bootstraps JS modules ](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev/js/src) are wirtten to support ES6 and export the class definition. This issue would require a slight tweak so that they are browser complaint, additionally, the import $ from jQuery declaration would need to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe upside of this, is that code such as \r\n\r\nimport {Alert} from './js/bootstrap/alert.js';\r\n\r\nwould now work when using <script type='module'>, which even though has somewhat [limited](https://caniuse.com/#search=modules) scope, still becomes a useful feature in the future. Especially now Chrome has added [dynamic imports](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import).\r\n\r\n## Changes required\r\n\r\nThe changes are trivial:\r\n\r\n1: Delete import $ from 'jquery' from each src module file\r\n\r\n2: \r\nimport Alert from './alert' \r\nbecomes \r\nimport Alert from './alert.js'\r\n\r\n3: In your HTML file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"module\">\r\n\r\n//import {Alert} from './js/bootstrap/index.js';\r\nimport Alert from './js/bootstrap/alert.js';\r\n\r\n//$(\".alert\").alert('close');\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use dynamic imports using this method too, although I have not personally tested this.\r\n\r\n## Performance benefits\r\n\r\nbootstrap.min.js (2298 lines) - 14.9kb\r\nutil.js (162 lines) - 4.2kb (unminified), **1.7kb minified**\r\nalert.js (193 lines) - 4.5kb (unminified), **1.7kb minified**\r\n\r\nLoading _only_ what you need, and loading _on demand_ has obvious advantages and is something that is possible today :)\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nSince the changes are fairly trivial, is it possible to integrate these into the v4 branch? I'm happy to PR some documentation changes. If it's possible to make this browser-module compatible without much effort that would be awesome. Heck, maybe they can be exported in a browser-module friendly format during build time.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n  \r\n  ",

It is a followup of PR #25050 because the discussion became a feature request and went out of scope of the PR content.\r\n\r\n**Situation**\r\n\r\nA group of radio buttons or checkboxes. For the application logic a certain requirement is posed on the group of inputs, but not on the individual inputs. For example (checkboxes): at least one checkbox must be checked, or the checkboxes must satisfy a certain relation.\r\n\r\nUsually, if radio buttons or checkboxes are grouped they are placed either in a `<fieldset>` or `<div>` which may have additional styling for a better UX. (This also helps users with a screen reader a lot.)\r\n\r\nOnce the form is submitted it is validated. That may be server side, or a client side JS library. Either way, often a class is added to the top level where the validation has occurred. For a normal text input this is the `<input>`. For the groups of radio buttons or checkboxes, this is the `<fieldset>` or `<div>`. It does not make sense to add the validity class to each child `<input>` element because the validity state does not depend on the input itself but rather on the group.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no support for adding either the `.is-valid` or the `.is-invalid` class the top-level validation element, without marking it as a form control (which is not correct, a wrapper is not an actual thing you can control). The labels of the checkboxes and/or radio buttons are not colored as invalid.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nBootstrap 3 markup (generated with a Symfony form) which achieves the required effect:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"form-group has-error\"><label class=\"col-sm-2 control-label\">C2</label>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-10\">\r\n        <div id=\"form_c2\">\r\n            <div class=\"radio\"> <label class=\"\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_placeholder\" name=\"form[c2]\" value=\"\" checked=\"checked\"> None</label>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"radio\"> <label class=\"\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_0\" name=\"form[c2]\" value=\"1\"> 0</label>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"radio\"> <label class=\"\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_1\" name=\"form[c2]\" value=\"2\"> 1</label>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"radio\"> <label class=\"\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_2\" name=\"form[c2]\" value=\"3\"> 2</label>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div><span class=\"help-block\">    <ul class=\"list-unstyled\"><li><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> This value should not be blank.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        </span>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBootstrap 4 markup. The current workaround in Symfony 3.4: adding the `.form-control` class to a grouping `<div>`.\r\n```html\r\n<fieldset class=\"form-group\">\r\n    <div class=\"row is-invalid\">\r\n        <legend class=\"col-sm-2 col-form-legend\">C2</legend>\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-10\">\r\n            <div id=\"form_c2\" class=\"form-control is-invalid\">\r\n                <div class=\"form-check\"><label class=\"form-check-label\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_placeholder\" name=\"form[c2]\" class=\"form-check-input\" value=\"\" checked=\"checked\"> None</label></div>\r\n                <div class=\"form-check\"><label class=\"form-check-label\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_0\" name=\"form[c2]\" class=\"form-check-input\" value=\"1\"> 0</label></div>\r\n                <div class=\"form-check\"><label class=\"form-check-label\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_1\" name=\"form[c2]\" class=\"form-check-input\" value=\"2\"> 1</label></div>\r\n                <div class=\"form-check\"><label class=\"form-check-label\"><input type=\"radio\" id=\"form_c2_2\" name=\"form[c2]\" class=\"form-check-input\" value=\"3\"> 2</label></div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"invalid-feedback\">\r\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled mb-0\">\r\n                    <li>This value should not be blank.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe image below is a comparison between BS 3 and BS 4 beta 2.\r\n\r\nWith the workaround:\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1073881/34318957-bfe49e6c-e7d4-11e7-9310-ef87e18d95af.PNG)\r\n\r\nWith the `.form-control` removed.

Many developers will \"upgrade\" jQuery before WP does.

[A better way is described by WP Engine](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/jquery_xss): WP developers should leave WP Core's library alone as to not break what is depending on them, and register a new version with `$.noConflict(true)`.\r\n\r\nIf Bootstrap looked for jQuery in some other global, `var twbs$ = jQuery.noConflict(true)` (naming variables is hard) would allow using a modern version of jQuery in Bootstrap, while preserving WP core's version for itself.\r\n\r\nThere may be other use-cases of wanting to use a jQuery that isn't on the `jQuery` or `$` globals.

This makes for a nice menu that appears outside of the \"toolbar\" area (the yellow hover).\r\n\r\nThe third menu does not appear nicely, because it is missing the \"dropup\" class which is needed to have popper affix to the parent according to the code in dropdown.js.\r\n\r\nGiven that in some cases, affixing to dropdown-toggle is desired, and in other cases, the parent of dropdown-toggle, I think this should just merely be a config option.

(it can even be hidden and programatically shown and still work). Another use case would be to position the menu aligned with the whole button for a split button dropdown:\r\n\r\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/dropdowns/#split-button-dropdowns\r\n\r\ninstead of aligned with the split button.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

The problem gets even bigger if you want to add another breakpoint. Now since `offset-*` classes are back this isn't helping either.\r\n\r\nIn order to have more granular control I would suggest to add more option variables to allow the developer to choose which helpers should be auto generated and which ones not. I'll add some examples below.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other plans or ideas in implementing such a feature? If necessary I would prepare a PR if this seems legit to be implement.\r\n\r\nIn case of `_flex.scss` it would be useful to limit the breakpoints for which the helpers should be generated as well as disabling some helpers at all. In this case I would suggest a new variable `$flex-breakpoints` which inherits its values from `$grid-breakpoints` as a default. Then I'd suggest the variables `$enable-flex-justify-content`, `$enable-flex-align-items`, `$enable-flex-align-content`, `$enable-flex-align-self` to enable or disable auto generation of these helpers. For the other `flex-*` helpers I'm currently unsure if there should be variables for each of them, or just disabling the wrap helpers or if we just keep them all the time as they were needed more often then the others.\r\n\r\nThe same scheme can be applied to `_grid-framework.scss` where I would create variables `$enable-grid-order` and `$enable-grid-offset` to disable them. Offsets, may not be used by many people since they had been removed and brought back in the newest beta.\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate your thoughts about this.

My suggestion would be able to set a max search depth.\r\n\r\nSecond problem is potential nested accordions. Although the parent selector could be the anchor to all other accordion events, which means the nested accordion would not get toggled unless they share the same parent id.\r\n\r\nA side benefit, this would greatly open the opportunity to sidebar menus with accordion collapse behaviors.\r\n\r\n## Concerns\r\nWhile I understand the need for performance to avoid having to traverse all parent to child nodes, a compromise could be made to allow a certain search depth. Also jQuery find(), used in some of the Bootstrap Source Javascript files, once traversed the DOM and selectors discovered is cached.",

But I was thinking about a little hack for which it seems that it would cost almost nothing to implement and could enable a pretty good indeterminate-like state.\r\n\r\nFirst, the problem that I have is that when you trigger an action in my GUI, it takes some time before the progress bar moves from 0%. So I'd like to show some animation in that time, to let the user know that the action was indeed triggered. Once the progress is strictly over 0%, then I would go back a more normal look. And my idea to give this feedback of indeterminate state is with the following CSS style:\r\n\r\n    progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated bg-faded\r\n\r\nSo, width 100%, faded+animated. With the gray style and full-width progress bar, I would be a pretty good indeterminate state, I think.\r\n\r\nObviously the issue for me is that bg-faded doesn't exist for the progress bar :-)\r\nSo the question is, do you think it would make sense to add it for that purpose, or you see it as a hack and don't want to add it?\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* aha I think I can achieve that myself by overriding the `background-color` to lightgray or something of the sort.

        "body": "With many/most components in Bootstrap there is an inverse variant that flips the background & foreground contrast. However, the `<code>` element does not have one. The `<code>` element is always presented with a white background and red text, regardless of the parent element having a light or dark background. On a dark background, it is a bit of an eye sore, in my opinion. Example:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"card card-inverse card-success\">\r\n    <div class=\"card-block\">\r\n        <p class=\"card-text\">\r\n            This is an example using <code>.card-success</code>.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am proposing that an inverse variant be created for `<code>`, perhaps `.code-inverse`? There are numerous ways this can be accomplished, but here is what I came up with that, in my opinion, works well against darker (but not close to black) backgrounds:\r\n```sass\r\ncode.code-inverse {\r\n    background-color: rgba($black, 0.1);\r\n    color: rgba($white, 0.99);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI used the `rgba()` SASS function to generate the RGBA values so that if the browser is old enough to not support alpha, it will just ignore the color properties and look the same as it does now. I played around with the alpha of the black background color and found 0.1 to be my preferred sweet spot that roughly equals the difference in alpha that `<code>` currently has on a light background.\r\n\r\nSomething similar could also be done for the `kbd` element for when the background color approaches black.",

[Feature request for that]\r\n\r\nContinuing on, I want to be able to use negative positioning, so in the same vein use `@include make-col-push(sm, -2)` (minus symbol), but the mixin looks at only calculating the position if it's greater than 0, otherwise making it default to 'auto'.\r\n\r\nNow, I am able to do this using the `make-col-offset` mixin and multiplying by a negative `grid-columns` number gives me the abilty to minus things by 12/17/Whatever/48/etc columns. Mucho useful. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.off-canvas {\r\n  @include make-col-offset(-3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutputs:\r\n```\r\n.off-canvas {\r\n  margin-left: -25%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the only drawback to this again is when designing for responsive views that have different column widths at different viewport sizes, so going back to that $size parameter. It would be great to be able to do the following:\r\n```\r\n.off-canvas {\r\n  @include make-col-offset(sm, -3);\r\n  @include make-col-offset(md, -4);\r\n  @include make-col-offset(lg, -5);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm doing the following as a workaround:\r\n```\r\n    @include media-breakpoint-up(xs) {\r\n      &.secondary {\r\n        @include make-col-offset(-8);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\r\n      &.secondary {\r\n        @include make-col-offset(-4);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {\r\n      &.secondary {\r\n        @include make-col-offset(-3);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts welcomed,\r\nD",

Some key ideas:\r\n\r\n1. `footer.footer-bottom`, which would push the footer element and its content to the bottom of the page. Currently, the only bottom-positioned element is a `.navbar` with the `.fixed-bottom` class. However, this utilizes fixed positioning and isn't really ideal (especially with large footer navs such as the one on the Google Developer website). Example usage `<footer class=\"footer-bottom\">Copyright 2017 Bootstrap</footer>`\r\n2. `footer ul.footer-nav`, or even more abstractly, something like `.nav-vertical` which could display navigation elements like an non-styled list with a little extra padding. The headers (`li.nav-vertical-header`) could have a heavier font.\r\n\r\nI may expand on this later, but I'd be interested in seeing what others think.",

The frontend developer then can decide if he want's images to scale up and down by using .img-fill or if he only wants them to scale down by using .img-fluid. \n\nI propose this as an official feature of Bootstrap 4.\n",

        "body": "I think it's very common use case that you want to have card content vertically in small screen and in bigger screens content is aligned horizontally. For example: http://www.apple.com/newsroom/\n\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22469162/18866616/74ae8352-84a9-11e6-9575-e31a9c8e6e2d.png)\n\nI implemented this for my own project roughly so that:\n\n```\n.card {    display: flex; flex-direction: column;}\n.card-img {    order: -1;}\n.card-block {    order: 0;}\n.card-img-last {    order: 1;}\n```\n\n.card-img-last is basically same than .card-img-bottom, but it doesn't care about order in source and also naming works better with horizontal cards where last refers to the right side.\n\nThen I have horizontal classes for cards which needs to be added in addition to basic card class:\n\n```\n.card-horizontal {    flex-direction: row;}\n.card-horizontal-sm-up { ... }\n.card-horizontal-md-up { ... } etc.\n\n.card-horizontal .card-img {    flex: 0 0 $card-img-width;}\n.card-horizontal .card-block {    flex: 0 0 calc(100% - $card-img-width)}\n```\n\nSomething like that, not a perfect example but gives the basic idea how it is working. I'm using card-block now as a flex item but it won't work if I want to have card header or footer. There should be some wrapper div which contains all content expect image.\n\nOnly problem with this is to make image behave well in horizontal view. In my implementation .card-img is just a div container, then img is inside that and I use object-fit (IE/Edge fix with Javascript) to cover the whole div. I've set minimum and maximum height for .card-block to have always reasonably sized image there.\n\nI would like to hear if this is wanted feature and then opinions what would be the correct implementation. Obviously we need to have also non-flex-box solution for that.\n",

The difference is only a difference in glyphs.\n\n| European Digits | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Arabic-Indic Digits** | \u0660 | \u0661 | \u0662 | \u0663 | \u0664 | \u0665 | \u0666 | \u0667 | \u0668 | \u0669 |\n\nFrom the Arabic user's point of view, Arabic-Indic numerals are the basic numerals used in almost all forms of documents such as most of government documents (IDs, birth certificates, driver's licenses, passports and household bills), bank statements, newspapers, calendars, road signs and menus.\n\n<br>\n### Options for Arabic Numeric Shaping\n\nThere are 3 options which should be taken into consideration when implementing national numeric shaping support in any framework/technology. These options are:\n- **None**: No shaping is performed, and the value appears as it is in the data source.\n- **National**: Digit shapes are determined from the user\u2019s language.\n- **Contextual**: Digit shapes are determined from the preceding characters in the buffer. European digits follow strong Latin character and Arabic-Indic digits follow strong Arabic character.\n  When there is no preceding strong characters, the base text direction attribute determines the digit shaping.(Arabic-Indic digits in RTL context and European digits in LTR context).\n\n| **Pseudo Sample** | 123 abc 456 _ARABIC_ 789 |\n| --- | :-- |\n| **Arabic Sample** | 123 abc 456 \u0623\u0628\u062c\u062f 789 |\n| **Sample Buffer** | ![sample buffer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/buff.png) |\n\n| Option | LTR Context | RTL Context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| None | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/01.png) | Same as LTR. |\n| Contextual | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/02.png) | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/03.png) |\n| National | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/04.png) | Same as LTR |\n\n<br>\n### Problem Statement\n\nMost of the available frameworks/technologies lack the contextual shaping option of national digits. Contextual digit shaping is a very important feature as the Arabic users don\u2019t expect to see Arabic-Indic numerals or European numerals only when they have mixed English and Arabic data. \n\nFor example if a document has many paragraphs some in Arabic and others in English, in the Arabic paragraphs the Arabic users expect to see national or Arabic-Indic numerals, and in the English paragraphs the Arabic users expect to see European numerals.\n\nSince the mixed English and Arabic data cases are very common in Arabic region, the same case with numerals is very common too.\n\n| ![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/fig1.png) |\n| :-: |\n| Figure 1: Sample communication thread using IBM Lotus Notes |\n\n| ![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/fig2.png) |\n| :-: |\n| Figure 2: Sample Arabic and English list of references. |\n\nArabic paragraphs that list references\u2019 names(which include numerals) are very common for Arabic users as well. In that case the Arabic users expect to see the numerals as European not Arabic-Indic.\n\n| ![Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACGC/national_numeric_shaping_draft/master/images/fig3.png) |\n| :-: |\n| Figure 3: Sample Arabic paragraph where users expect to see European numerals. |\n\n<br>\n\n**_So direct conversion of digits from latin to national will not fulfil Arabic users\u2019 needs.\nContextual behavior is the core numeric shaping option that is needed from the Arabic users\u2019 point of view._**\n<br>\n\n**# About how to do that at Bootstrap:**\nI will add a function at each js file under JS folder to support digit shape at each component\nAnd the core numeric shape js file will be placed at a separate util module \n",

Since the display sizes are quite small, you usually can't see the table header any more if the height of the table is bigger than the height of the screen. The project [stickyRows](http://maslianok.github.io/stickyRows/default.html) gives a good demonstration of what I mean.\n\nThis project is a bit too complicated though, because it includes handling of different types of table headers and stacking of those. What I think should really be part of Bootstrap 4, is a class like `.table-sticky-header` (similarly to `.navbar-fixed-top`) that you can add to each `.table` and then Bootstrap does the rest and always keeps the current `<thead>`-section on the top until the last row scrolled to the top or the next `<thead>`-section goes up.\n",

Another way to achieve the same effect would be to use the first row as a template, and to apply this style to subsequent rows.\n\nOn my current layout, I have 11 attribute-value pairs, so I would save 20 ((11-1)*2) classes if I could specify this on a parent or template element. This would improve brevity (and, in my opinion, legibility) and reduce room for errors.\n\nHas this been proposed for Bootstrap 4 (or previous versions)?

In current versions, it generates a lot of collisions and the need to make up confusing names for my own classes.\n## An example\n\nIf I want to use `.card` as a base for a class of my own (`@extend`ing it), the whole CSS for `.cards` would end up in the final CSS together with my implementation.\n\nIt also brings concerns regarding existing classes. eg: `.card` could be a semantically significant element in my page.\n## An idea on how to solve it\n\nSass enables us to create silent classes, that are not expressed in the final CSS. This could be used (as an opt-in; just like the current flex-grid) to use Bootstrap as a mixin library.\n\nBootstrap:\n\n``` scss\n// bootstrap/scss/_card.scss\n%card {\n  // all the declarations for .card elements (current code)\n}\n@if not($silent-classes) {\n  .card { @extend %card }\n}\n```\n\nCustom SCSS\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap/scss/card\";\n\n.projects {\n  // class definition for the wrapper\n  &__item { @extend %card }\n}\n```\n\nThis is not a perfect solution as it would still generate child elements with the original names (although this already happens when using mixins like `card-inverse`) and would force the user to `@extend` a lot of classes (like `.card-block` by doing a `.projects__item-content { @extend %card-block }`).\n\nThat said, as far as I can think, this would not change anything when using bootstrap as is, but it would give a lot more power for experienced developers who want to use Bootstrap together with their existing codebases.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?  \nAny better ideas on how to achieve this?  \nWould this change be welcome?\n",

Bootstrap currently has a basic implementation of structure, however I strongly think it could be improved using Harry's concept. I've created a repo that utilizes some of the [Bootstrap Partials](https://github.com/cameronjroe/bootstrap-itscss) in this manner. \n\nRecently, I've wanted to also have variables closely tied with their components. Rather than going through a monolithic `_variables.scss` partial, I've wanted to modify all a single component's color, padding, etc in a partial specifically for that component: Ex. `_modal-vars.scss`, `_panel-vars.scss`.\n\nI'm curious to gauge the community's stand on this subject and potentially propose a structure that would aim to help the developers improve the speed of customizing and extending Bootstrap following a well architected partial structure. For example, a structure with directories for each component, yet still imported into a `_bootstrap.scss` partial, but slotted in correctly based on a ITCSS architecture. \n\nI'd love to hear feedback or loop into an open issue on this.

While i was working at it i realised the amount of flexibility it provides is just amazing, i could change the breakpoints AND the number of columns, wow   man! that was amazing.\n\nI also leaned about sass-script and the awesome things you can do with them.So i came-up with an cool idea:\n\nbootstrap provides six basic classes: `primary, secondary, info, danger, warning, and success`. These classes are used in all components: Buttons, labels, alerts, etc. Instead of hard coding these classes why don\u2019t we let the user create them.\n\nTo better explain things i created [this repository, check it out](https://github.com/Code-Lobster/Bootstrap-ultra-buttons-system). We can create a sass map of these properties and let the user change the map and css will be generated accordingly just like [Bootstrap ultra button system](https://github.com/Code-Lobster/Bootstrap-ultra-buttons-system).That way users can have exactly the classes they want.\n\nThis will have large impact on how people use bootstrap, i think this will encourage people to start editing bootstrap directly and not add extra css file on top of bootstrap to override it\u2019s rules. Not only that it will promote use of css pre-compilers, this will also accelerate the growth of the css pre-compilers themselves (because we will be using lots of advanced features). Long story short it\u2019s better for web in general :)\n\nI understand implementing this will take lots of time (may be you will leave it for bootstrap 5) and you guys are very very busy. But hey, i am a student who is really into bootstrap and i have some time in my hand, vacations are coming and i was thinking for doing an internship anyways. I would be glad to become a volunteer, not only for this modification but bootstrap in general, i can try and fix most of those v4 issues. On demand i can send my resume as well :)\n\nThanks for reading,\nRegards Karan\n",

Therefore I think it would be nice to have config file where we could specify minimum supported browser version.

There could be defaults of course what you guys want to support offically and then people who want to tweak it could increase the level.

My `ng-repeat` inside the `card-columns` div and it looks like:\n\n| 1st | 39th | 72nd |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2nd | 40th | 73rd |\n| 3rd | 41st | 74th |\n| 4th | 42nd | 75th |\n\nAnd so on. \n\n[Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) has support for ordering across across rows, which is very important for _large_ lists because you often want your higher order items to be the first that are visible first for your users.\n\n| 1st | 2nd | 3rd |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4th | 5th | 6th |\n\nObviously, this is how a list of `col-md-4` divs would look, but it breaks up badly when the content of those divs have different heights. Is it possible to use `card-columns` but order in rows?

It\u2019s sometimes useful to have columns even below $screen-xs-min (although not that much without changing the gutter size), but the difference in behaviour with the rest of tiers make it confusing, IMO. Maybe it would be better to have default col-\\* styles between 0px and $screen-xs-min and make xs work like the rest.\n- (B) Add an least an additional breakpoint for small devices. Even with the previous fix, the distance between xs and sm is too big, anyways.\n- (C) Allow easily setting a different grid at a custom breakpoint using a make-column mixin. Right now, I workaround it using:\n\n```\n  @media (min-width: $bp-bigger-than-xs) {\n    @include make-xs-column(4);\n  }\n```\n- (D) Allow different font-sizes for different breakpoints. Using rem instead of px is not enough, the proportion between body and headings is not usually kept constant between desktop and mobile screen sizes.\n- (E) Keep specificity to a minimum and avoid deep selectors, using specialized classes instead. It would make overriding styles easier (no need to replicate bootstrap selectors) and would decouple from the predefined html structure that some components require. The worst offender is the navbar, but there are others (carousel, pager, panel).\n- (F) Decouple the javascript from the html and CSS and use custom attributes or specific js-\\* classes. (e.g. accordion effect only works with .panel)\n- Improve mobile experience. (G) Animations should be fluid (e.g. navbar toggle), (H) switching between dropdowns should require just 1 click.\n",

Other popular libraries provide this functionality in some way right out of the box.\n\nExample:\njQuery.fn.jquery\nko.version\n\nI have run across a use case where I need to be able to do the following:\n\nWe need to be able to render fragments of HTML into an existing page. To prevent bloating the page and loading the same assets twice without actually knowing anything about the consuming page, I want to from the child fragment HTML detect if these libraries are loaded on the parent page and detect their exact version number for compatibility reasons. Only if a version that isn't compatible is loaded would I then load the required asset. \n\nWith jQuery and Knockout which are two of the libraries that may already be loaded on my parent page this is trivial but with Bootstrap it is not. The two most popular techniques for detecting the Bootstrap version are:\n1. To attempt to detect whether its Bootstrap 2 by checking if the typeahead plugin exists. This is not reliable at all and can give a false positive if any jQuery plugin named typeahead is loaded.\n   var bsVersion = ( typeof $.fn.typeahead !== 'undefined' ? '2.3.2' : '3.0.x' );\n2. To explicitly load the CSS file as text and parse the comment at the top for the version number. This assumes that we want to detect the version from a known asset. This does not provide the means for detecting the version that may be loaded on the page already (which may be different from the one that you have access to).\n   $.get(\"dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\", function (data) {\n   var version = data.match(/v[.\\d]+[.\\d]/);\n   alert(version);\n   });\n\nI propose that Bootstrap adds something like:\n\njQuery.fn.bootstrap \n\nwhich much like jQuery.fn.jquery returns the version number of the library that is loaded. \n\nI'm not sure what the reason behind putting the version on every plugin explicitly such as Alert.VERSION = '3.3.4' is but it doesn't seem to provide the information without actually creating an instance of that plugin. EDIT: Didn't realize you didn't have to create an instance but in my comment below I expressed that it will only tell you that SOME plugin is loaded named Alert with a VERSION number, not that Bootstrap loaded it.\n\nI apologize if this has been brought up before as I couldn't find an existing issue. If there are other alternatives that already exist to solve this problem please let me know.\n",

        "body": "Hello all.\n\nI'd first like to preface this with a little about myself. I am the primary maintainer for the [Drupal Bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) base-theme. It currently has over 60k installs, so needless to say we get a lot of our own issues.\n\nRecently, I started the task of trying to tackle better anchor and scrolling support in the base-theme. Support for anchors or scrolling to them has always been a big pain, for not only me, but also a lot of others; especially when dealing with fixed navbars [[jsbin](http://jsbin.com/qimuqu/2)].\n\nThe code I currently have in the project was rather hack-ish and completely un-configurable (my feeble attempt to satisfy a growing issue), so I set out to tackle this once and for all [https://www.drupal.org/node/2462645]. I've poured over countless blogs, docs, support forums and even found a few in this project's issue queue [#193, #1768, #11854].\n\nThe \"solutions\" vary from CSS to JS, but more often than not require at least some sort of manual configuration for it to work with that specific theme/offset requirement.\n\nUltimately though, I've determined that a CSS-only solution just doesn't really cut it; especially when dealing with dynamic and varying content as such in CMS framework like Drupal. So, I've created the following JS based plugin instead:\n\nhttps://github.com/markcarver/bootstrap-anchor [[demo/docs](http://markcarver.github.io/bootstrap-anchor/)]\n\nIn an effort to offset the \"cost\" for using JS, I was also inspired with the recent addition using anchor.js for Bootstrap's own documentation (#14897, #15491). This got me to thinking how this could easily be expanded from Bootstrap's own Tooltip plugin, like Popovers are. What makes it even more enticing is that there has been a `glyphicon-link` available to use for quite a while.\n\nSince both Tooltips and Popovers are completely opt-in with no data API support, it made sense to follow in that direction; especially for those who still want/need a CSS-only solution.\n\nMy ultimate goal/desire is to merge this upstream into Bootstrap directly. I'm sure this will be a daunting task which is why I'm creating this issue now to get some feedback and eyes on this plugin so it can be flushed out a bit more. I'm still working on documentation of all the new options, so bare that in mind.\n\nI look forward to y'alls feedback!\n",

Debugging might not be possible in a `shown`, because that event happens in a different scope.\n\nThis isn't terribly difficult to deal with, but adds a complicated step and one has to edit multiple things/files for testing.

        "body": "The **goal**: to have the ability of making mobile-first & mobile-only (?) columns, and easily and transparently \"undo\" them on larger breakpoints.\n\nAs you all know, _currently_, Bootstrap lets you make columns starting from the smallest breakpoint you would like those columns to be rendered. For example, if you want a 2-column layout (each column taking up to 50% of the viewport) on every breakpoint, you would use `.make-xs-column(6)`. That mixing would then compile the code necessary for a 2-column layout for the smallest breakpoint and up to the largest one. Similarly, if you want those columns to be rendered only starting from a larger breakpoint, you would then use `.make-sm-column(6)`, `.make-md-column(6)` or `.make-lg-column(6)`, depending at which breakpoint would you like the columns to begin to exist.\nWow, very responsive, such mobile, so first.\n\nBut what if you would like to achieve the exact opposite. That is, **to create columns for smaller breakpoints _only_**, without the need to \"undo\" the (applied) styles on larger breakpoints.\n\n**Enter `.make-*-column-max()` and `.make-*-row-max()` mixins.**\n\nThe trick is simple, and mobile-first-compatible too: to rely on `@media (max-width: @screen-*-max) { ... }`.\n\nI've done a _really_ quick & dirty test on my local copy, and so far, **it seems to work properly**.\nOn `/less/mixins/grid.less`, we would then add a few mixins like the followings:\n\n```\n\n// Rows\n.make-xs-row-max(@gutter: @grid-gutter-width) {\n  @media (max-width: @screen-xs-max) {\n    margin-left:  (@gutter / -2);\n    margin-right: (@gutter / -2);\n    .clearfix; // Note: clearfix used as mixin because we can't extend from within a media query.\n  }\n}\n\n.make-sm-row-max(@gutter: @grid-gutter-width) {\n  @media (max-width: @screen-sm-max) {\n    margin-left:  (@gutter / -2);\n    margin-right: (@gutter / -2);\n    .clearfix; // Note: clearfix used as mixin because we can't extend from within a media query.\n  }\n}\n\n// ... and so on for larger breakpoints...\n\n// Columns\n.make-xs-column-max(@columns; @gutter: @grid-gutter-width) {\n  @media (max-width: @grid-float-breakpoint-max) {\n    position: relative;\n    float: left;\n    width: percentage((@columns / @grid-columns));\n    min-height: 1px;\n    padding-left:  (@gutter / 2);\n    padding-right: (@gutter / 2);\n  }\n\n.make-sm-column-max(@columns; @gutter: @grid-gutter-width) {\n  @media (max-width: @screen-sm-max) {\n    position: relative;\n    min-height: 1px;\n    padding-left:  (@gutter / 2);\n    padding-right: (@gutter / 2);  \n    float: left;\n    width: percentage((@columns / @grid-columns));\n  }\n}\n\n// ... and so on for large breakpoints...\n```\n\n(as you can see, there is some repeated code -properties, mainly- that could probable be abstracted away with some other mixin, but that's another story)\n\nThe _main benefit_ I see is the ability to easily create rows & columns for narrower viewports and \"revert back\" to full-width on larger viewports, if needed, while avoiding the need of \"undoing\" styles (that is, already applied properties).\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n",

This is less issue on static web pages, however with dynamic pages or _single-page web applications_ (e.g. AngularJS based) it becames very uncomfortable and distracting.\n\nTo workaround this a standard solution is to force browsers to always show vertical scrollbar by setting `overflow-y: scroll` on `<body>` element.

This way themes can have more control over the popover arrow colors in different scenarios.

This is fairly easy; I do this by importing `bootstrap.less` in my own `project.less`, and then declaring the variables that I need to modify.\n2. Remove some modules. I currently do this by:\n   - Copying `bootstrap.less` to my project.\n   - Commenting out the imports that I do not need from `bootstrap.less`.\n   - Importing this modified `bootstrap.less` into my `project.less`, as above.\n   - I run the LESS processor to compile `project.less`, adding the Bootstrap source path (like `bower_components/bootstrap/less`) to the include paths (so it can find the files referenced from `bootstrap.less`.)\n\nI have an idea for simplifying the second scenario. How about we use variables to control whether each module is included or not? We could use [CSS guards in LESS](http://lesscss.org/features/#css-guards-feature) for this. In each file that's imported from `bootstrap.less`, we could enclose the code in a guard like this:\n\n```\n& when (@include-grid = true) {\n\n//\n// Grid system\n// --------------------------------------------------\n\n// ... the rest of grid.less ...\n\n}\n```\n\nWe'll have to add a bunch of these `@include-xxx: true;` declarations in `variables.less` or similar.\n\nWith this in place, I'll then be able to just import `bootstrap.less` into my `project.less` from a copy of the unmodified Bootstrap, and declare the modules that I do not need like this:\n\n```\n@include-glyphicons: false;\n@include-grid: false;\n```\n\nThat would make for a fairly clean and easy build with my customizations built-in.\n\nP.S.

In the following example, only \"Hover over me\" gets a tooltip:\n\n``` html\n<span title=\"hover-tooltip\" class=\"hover-tooltip\">Hover over me</span>\n<span title=\"click-tooltip\" class=\"click-tooltip\">Click on me</span>\n<script>\n  $('body').tooltip({selector: '.hover-tooltip', trigger: 'hover'});\n  $('body').tooltip({selector: '.click-tooltip', trigger: 'click'});\n</script>\n```\n\nSeems like it would be nice to be able to set up multiple delegated selectors on a node.  Would probably require a bit of work though, but if there's an interest in this, I could work on a pull request.\n",

There is nothing wrong with the current dropdown style navigation in mobile and I'm not against it, I just like the off-canvas style more.\n\nOf course this would not be applicable for every website, but same as the dropdown style either. So it would be good if we can have an option depending on what kind of website we are working on. In my own opinion, the off-canvas style is more \"mobile\" than the dropdown because we can see it more often in mobile apps.\n\nHere is a very good example:\nhttp://designmodo.github.io/startup-demo/framework/samples/sample-04/index.html\nAs you can see the links automatically becomes the off-canvas navigation when in small screen.\n\nAnyone with me?\n",

I propose we also support list groups.  List groups support active links, which makes them a good candidate for navigation elements, therefore ScrollSpy should support them.\n\nI have an idea about how to do this, but it's really rough, so I'm just going to describe it here instead making a full pull request.  If people think the idea is good, I'll write it up and create the pull request.\n\nWe could either try and detect a list group, or allow passing an option to specify list-group mode.  I'm going with the latter.  \n\nThis would require implementing the selector something like this:\n\n``` js\nthis.selector       = (this.options.target\n       || ((href = $(element).attr('href')) && href.replace(/.*(?=#[^\\s]+$)/, '')) //strip for ie7\n       || '') + (this.options.listGroup ? ' a' : ' .nav li > a')\n```\n\nand the activation code like this:\n\n``` js\n    var active;\n    if (this.options.listGroup) {\n      active = $(this.selector);\n    } else {\n      active = $(this.selector)\n        .parentsUntil(this.options.target, '.active');\n    }\n    active.removeClass('active');\n\n    var selector = this.selector +\n        '[data-target=\"' + target + '\"],' +\n        this.selector + '[href=\"' + target + '\"]'\n\n    if (this.options.listGroup) {\n      active = $(selector);\n    } else {\n      active = $(selector)\n        .parents('li');\n    }\n    active.addClass('active'); \n```\n\nInterestingly enough the code is simpler for the list group case.  \n\nWhat does everyone think?

I have the whole thing working perfectly using custom jQuery-based JS code that adds and removes the relevant classes as the field validation succeeds or fails. \n\nUnder BS 2.3.x, I had used home-brew colorized glyphicon image files, some custom CSS, and the help-inline class for this purpose, but with help-inline's demise and the switch to font-based glyphicons in BS 3, I switched to using input-groups and adjusted my code accordingly.\n\n~~The problem is a minor aesthetic issue with how input-groups containing a glyphicon are rendered in a browser. Whenever the glyphicons appear in the input-group-addon, the whole input-group-addon shifts downward by a couple of pixels in every browser (Mac and Win, including IE 8-11) other than FF. Frankly, it looks tacky.~~\n\n~~If I use the radical and times HTML entities from a standard webfont instead of a glyphicon, the input-group-addon doesn't shift, but none of the standard web fonts have versions of these entities that look half as good as a glyphicon.~~\n\nAnother issue that I would appreciate help with is for you to create a blank glyphicon (glyphicon-blank) that can be used as a placeholder in a stateless input-group-addon so the input-group-addon won't change sizes as the checkmark or X appear.\n\n I created a stub page to illustrate the problems at:\n\n```\n http://www.lcudev.com/test.php \n```\n\nA working example of a production form using my technique is at:\n\n```\n http://www.lcudev.com/problem-report/index.php\n```\n\nIf the site asks you to authenticate, the username is \"dev\" and the password is \"dev123\".

Say I want to keep my file size small and I import only the Less files I need. Suddenly I need to use a carousel. Instead of importing `carousel.less` _and_ `carousel.js` in the _right_ order, I would just `$ bower install bootstrap-carousel`. I get _both_ files from the main property in `bower.json` - so I can bundle them automatically with my build script. And I get the right order of dependencies (e.g. if  `carousel.less` depends on `buttons.less` I also get the `bootstrap-buttons` package and my build script can import it before `carousel.less`, because it knows the dependency from `bower.json`).\n- It keeps documentation, tests and examples - maybe even variables - separated. You can even release single components independent from each other. (This was also very helpful for GruntJS, even if this is a JS-only project...)\n- Components can easily be exchanged. You remember when you deprecated Bootstraps typeahead, in favor for Twitters typeahead? The Angular team recently did something similar themselves: They separated their router into its own module, because many people liked to use a 3rd-party router (e.g. `ui-router`) instead. I know Angular is a different project and JS-only, but the problem is the same with typeahead. Now it is easier to use Angular with a different router. The same could be done with Bootstrap: E.g. take all of Bootstraps buttons, but choose a different grid...\n- [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/) uses this approach [succesfully](https://github.com/topcoat/topcoat/blob/master/package.json).

The desired result is that once a user clicks the submit button, the button is immediately disabled and remains disabled until the dialog is destroyed, but in the meantime the button state gets updated to indicate the status of the save request (e.g., maybe \"Processing...\", \"Saving...\", \"Saved\", etc).\n\nBootstrap does not provide a good way to do this. The problem is that setting the button state to anything other than \"loading\" will enable the button after the current event stack has been processed.\n\n(The only workarounds that I'm aware of involve a hack using setTimeout to set the \"disabled\" attribute again after it is enabled, or to set the text of the button without setting the state, neither of which is desirable.) \n\n(This is a duplicate of https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/3034, but that issue was closed a year ago for lack of detail.)\n\nA rough, simplified example of the problem do can be seen at:\nhttp://bootply.com/84160\n\nThe Bootstrap code in question is:\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/button.js\nlines 35-53, in the Button.prototype.setState method.\n\nAlso pasted at:\nhttp://codepaste.dev7studios.com/item/ml2kpybyn\n\nThe problem appears to be two-fold. One problem is that the code setting the disabled state of the button is located inside a call to setTimeout(function () {...}, 0), placing it at the _end_ of the current event stack. The other is that setting the button to _any_ state other than 'loading' will cause the button to be enabled. If either of these was fixed, the workaround would be easy.\n\nI think the \"best practice\" solution would be to allow the devloper to control the enabled/disabled state of the button when setting the state, which could be easily accomplished one of two ways:\n1. Adding an additional parameter to the setState method. (Maybe a flag to indicate the button's state? Or an object defining additional options to set for the button?)\n2.

Yes, I could change this offset with JS, but that's needless tight-coupling.\n\nIf it described instead the scroll pos. to element offset, I could set it to 0 and it would affix no matter what is happening above it.

Although it's too early for implementation code and pull requests, choosing the right approach now helps in the planning, and directing the efforts towards a specific goal (as many people have already volunteered for the task).\n\nI think the biggest issue is the lack of a standard, or best practices for adding RTL support for themes and pages. First, I want to review some of the current practices for RTL support in different parts of the web.\n- WordPress: uses RTL overrides, in a single seperate file named rtl.css, auto-loaded by WordPress in right-to-left pages. [explained here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Right-to-Left_Language_Support)\n- Drupal 7: uses RTL overrides, in a separate file with -rtl.css prefix for every css file loaded by themes, etc. again, auto-loaded in right-to-left pages. [explained here](https://drupal.org/node/222782)\n- Drupal 8: favors RTL overrides prefixed by <code>[dir=\"rtl\"]</code>, alongside the base css (no separate files). explained [here](https://drupal.org/node/2032405); also, see the [related discussion](https://drupal.org/node/2015789)\n- RTL-This (a website dedicated to turning everything RTL): Has an article comparing different ways to add RTL to css [here](http://rtl-this.com/tutorial/3-different-ways-rtl-your-css).\n- Another article by a css-expert (Jens O. Meiert): ... Indicate directionality by the dir attribute on the html element ... Avoid a separate RTL style sheet; find all declarations that specify anything specific to the left or right ... customize those declarations, and use some hook to apply them\u2014like e.g. setting id=\"rtl\" on the body element (well, you really want to use html[dir=\"rtl\"]). article [here](http://meiert.com/en/blog/20081211/5-rtl-tips/).\n- Another popular approach is to prefix all RTL rules with a .rtl class (and possibly .ltr for base rules, to prevent overrides). per #3133, #6423, and the [less-bidi](https://github.com/danielkatz/less-bidi) model.\n\nI'd suggest using an approach than could satisfy these different requirements by simple customizations.\n1. I suggest keeping the RTL rules in a separate css file. Clearly, merging them into a single stylesheet (when required) would be a single copy-paste at the end of the base css.\n2. I suggest using overrides (vs mixins, or automated tools) in a separate .less file. Then, adding any combination of prefixes, or <code>[dir=</code> rules is as easy as a few lines of .less code. example:\n\n```\n[dir=\"rtl\"] {\n  @include \"bootstrap-rtl.less\"\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n.ltr {\n  @include \"bootstrap.less\";\n}\n\n.rtl {\n  @include \"bootstrap-rtl.less\";\n}\n```\n",

This way we can put them inside a panel-body DIV for normal rendering.\n\n![panelexample](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1693635/972953/bca0223a-0610-11e3-807a-418b5bd1179d.jpg)\n",

Likewise, the `.make-column()` mixin works the same way.  If the gutter width was a parameter to the mixins, I could (for example) make a custom condensed grid like so:\n\n```\n@condensed-gutter-width: 8px;\n.row-condensed {\n    .make-row(@condensed-gutter-width);\n    .col-lg-1 {\n        .make-column(1,@condensed-gutter-width);\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n...then when I wanted to use the condensed grid, I could just use `row-condensed` instead of `row` in my CSS.\n\nThis would be even easier with an extra mixin such as `.make-columns(@gutter-width)` to batch out all the columns at once.\n",

It's simply that fancy gradients make things harder to further customize heavily compared to plain solid colors.\n\nCaveats:\n- Just getting \"plain\" v3.0.0 fully polished and out the door is going to take a lot of effort, so it's possible/likely that this theme might not get made until some time after the release of v3.0.0-final.\n- These plans are not finalized. @mdo could change his mind.\n",

They both kinda look like input boxes, but are grayed out and inmodifiable.\n- As of semantics, they are both contained in `<input>` tags. As a developer, it feels weird putting constants in `<input>` tags. They are clearly not input.\n\nAnother possible solution (modified from the documentation) is\n\n``` html\n<form class=\"bs-docs-example form-horizontal\">\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputUsername\">Username</label>\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      JensRantil\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputPassword\">Password</label>\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      <input type=\"password\" id=\"inputPassword\" placeholder=\"Password\">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      <label class=\"checkbox\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\"> Remember me\n      </label>\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn\">Sign in</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nwhich yields\n\n![screenshot3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/730342/642297/45856248-d355-11e2-8937-37c72555edb4.png)\n. As you can see, `form.form-horizontal` has artefacts for constant text.\n\nI've been visiting reading the [W3C spec for `disabled`/`readonly`](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.12) to understand their semantic intent, but the description is very technical. So far, I haven't understood whether any of them should cover my case.\n\nIf `disabled` is for the case of presenting constants, then I would propose Boostrap would style `input:disabled` as regular text without borders etc. However since I can't defer that from the spec, **my proposal is a class that avoids the artefact in the screenshot, a `.controls.controls-static` class with correct margin.**.\n\nI'd love to hear your input on this.\n",

For left and right placements, you will need to use a slight variation:\n\n``` javascript\nif (tp.top < 0) {\n    tp.top = $(this.options.container).offset().top;\n    $tip.children(\".arrow\").css(\"top\", this.$element.offset().top - tp.top + (this.$element.height() / 2));\n}\n```\n\nHere is the end result, notice how the popover is now all contained inside the window:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1044882/432977/f19c5088-aeb5-11e2-8bf1-77d01a0a774e.png)\n\nI'm really interested in hearing opinions on whether this is the right fix for this issue.

This makes it difficult to track and unbind all events, that the plugins are attaching. \n\nWhy the need for destroy method? In my case I want some plugins (especially Carousel) to switch on and off, depending on the size of the window (on for wide window, off for narrow window). The state should be updated as the user resizes the window. And I don't want the running in background when they are not needed.\n\nFor the time being, I guess I will rewrite a bit my copy of bootstrap.js, adding the namespaces to event attachments, and some simple destroy, but I would appreciate if this feature would be available by default.\n\nRegards\nOliwer\n",

Forgive me for re-opening the same issue, but I just worked on my first bootstrap powered Django project, and I found myself frustrated with how to keep up with bootstrap changes long-term.\n\nIn particular, I found the following rather limiting while trying to maintain the original bootstrap source:\n- Checking out as git submodule includes docs and tests relevant to docs, along with mustache templates I don't need / use\n- Make file doesn't include a raw copy / build command for the bootstrap less and JS files (only minified / compressed versions)\n- In framework like Django, cannot be added as submodule easily updated vis-a-vis Python packages\n## Separate Repository Solution\n\nMy suggestion would be, as was noted before, to split out a bootstrap core without the extraneous jslint and other test suites and only include the js, images and less files.  If checked out as a git submodule directly from twitter/bootstrap, modifications can be made using custom less files in other paths while maintaining / preserving the bootstrap source.  This makes updates easier -- less copy / paste.\n## Make File Solution\n\nIf the source were maintained as a single git repo, modifying the make file to generate / copy clean v.2.1.x js, images and less files to a target path would be a good compromise.  One does not want all the doc files (including custom less and mustache templates) littering, say, their Django static media paths (e.g. /css, /less, /js, /imgs).\n\nMine is a specific example, but #1096 hinted at similar questions / issues with the repo setup.\n\nRegardless -- thx for all you guys do.  We, at my office, love this project.  Keep up the great work.\n",

But I still think an effortless lightbox plugin should be present in Bootstrap, considering how crucial have lightboxes become for pictures zooming nowadays.\n\nPlugins like [Colorbox](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) let you create lightboxes on your images simply by putting a _rel_ tag on a picture and initiating colorbox(). If I want to do the same thing with Bootstrap, I have to manually create the div#modal in my body for every picture that I want in a lightbox, and that doesn't allow for slideshows, image resizing etc.\n\nI'm aware that for every plugin request there is in the Issues list, it's always possible to answer \"You can just add it yourself\" and it is true - I can just do like I did in the old days and add Colorbox to every website I want lightboxes in. But that's not my point, Bootstrap is made to speed up the creation of a website by giving an easy access to the most commonly used tools and assets. But while I don't think people use Scrollspy-like navigation or progress bars every day, I see lightboxes on 90% of the websites I go to.\nSo in my opinion - and only mine - I think you should reconsider one last time the add of lightboxes in Bootstrap, for the benefit of everyone.\n",

We've seen this be a consistent problem across different web browsers. I was using a previous version of Chrome (sorry didn't write it down) but upgraded to the latest before this, version 83.0.4103.61, interestingly enough, I see the same issue but slightly different.\r\n\r\nThe overall issue is I have a page using bootstrap, card-columns and youtube videos via iframes and some videos are not appearing as they should. You can see in the image below, I have 3 columns of cards using the card-columns class and originally, any video that was in the leftmost column worked, but any video in the middle and right columns didn't. After upgrading chrome to the latest version, it's the opposite, videos in the middle and right column work while any in the left column don't. They flash black when you first load the page and then blank out. You can never see the video, but if you hover over where the play button should be and click it, you can hear the video but never see it. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1134\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-01 at 12 57 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18473899/83438737-8f0de400-a407-11ea-8975-b9642316784c.png\">\r\n\r\nWe work in a djangocms project, where this was originally seen, I took the html and put in a blank page so we could try to narrow down the issue. We took everything out except the cards & bootstrap and the issue remains, leading us to believe it is a purely bootstrap issue. Some more details, we believe that the video itself is being pushed far to the right, if you inspect the page & select a singe video and slowly increase its width upwards of 100%, you will start to see it, from the right of the card and then move further left as you increase the width. \r\n\r\nThis is a problem i've spent several days on and have made very little progress. I believe it lies somewhere in bootstrap and card-columns specifically. I don't believe it is with any video since they were originally put on the page via a djangocms plugin, hence all similar, and since we copy and pasted them, moved them around, and the issue always persisted. If we took a working video and put it in a different column, it would run into this issue, but if we took a broken video and put it in a working column, it would work. Also, if we copy & pasted the entire card and/or iframe anywhere outside of card-columns it would work. I've attached the html page I slapped together to ensure it was just the bootstrap. This is my first time posting to the bootstrap repo but I should've followed all the guidelines, let me know if anyone has questions or need any further info, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[test.html.zip](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/files/4712771/test.html.zip)\r\n",

        "body": "### Bug description:\r\n\r\nWhen a modal is shown on a scrollable page, the scrollbar is hidden and the page body is padded to compensate for the lost width. Depending on display settings and the browsers zoom level, this padding is sometimes applied, even when the page body is not scrollable and there is no scrollbar to begin with.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can tell this happens, when the value `right = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().right` rounds up, i.e. if `right - Math.floor(right) > 0.5`. You can check it yourself on [this](https://bootstrap-scrollbar-handling.stackblitz.io) demo site ([full Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/bootstrap-scrollbar-handling)).\r\n\r\nNote that in order for the value to be non-integer, the page must be rendered in a non-native resolution. This can be done by zooming in or out of the page, or by scaling the display in system settings like [these](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-custom-display-scaling-setting-windows-10) in Windows.\r\n\r\n### Tested browsers:\r\n\r\nI tested and reproduced this bug on **Windows 10** with the following browsers:\r\n\r\n* Firefox 70.0.1\r\n* Chrome 78.0.3904.97\r\n* Edge 44.18362.449.0\r\n* Internet Explorer 11.476.18362.0\r\n\r\n### Related issues:\r\n\r\nAs #28101 this issue regards the padding introduced to compensate for scrollbars. While in that issue padding is applied when the scrollbar cannot be hidden, this issue is about padding that is applied when no scrollbar was shown to begin with.\r\n\r\nI originally posted this at https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/3448, but now realised that the same issue occurs in the plain Bootstrap implementation as well (and for the same reason).\r\n\r\n### Suggested fix\r\n\r\nSome rounding must be applied in the method [_checkScrollbar](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/src/modal.js#L450) to accomodate for non-integer values:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  _checkScrollbar() {\r\n    const rect = document.body.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n    this._isBodyOverflowing = Math.round(rect.left + rect.right) < window.innerWidth\r\n    this._scrollbarWidth = this._getScrollbarWidth()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for the scenarios I tested.

Apologies if I should have posted in the closed issue.\r\n\r\nI've been hitting a problem in Bootstrap 4 (wasn't able to reproduce the issue in Bootstrap 3) whereby I position an element over a Bootstrap modal when it opens (a date picker for my use case, but it applies to any overlay). I use `shown.bs.modal` to know when the modal is visible and the transition is complete - the [docs say](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/#events)\r\n\r\n> show.bs.modal | This event fires immediately when the\u00a0show\u00a0instance method is called. If caused by a click, the clicked element is available as the\u00a0relatedTarget\u00a0property of the event.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've been finding that the `shown` event triggers before the CSS transition is completed. The [test case](http://jsfiddle.net/fouavchs/1/) demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"Launch demo modal\" button in the output view (I've just used the docs demo HTML for the modal)\r\n2. Observe that the blue line is just above the model footer initially.\r\n3. After a second observe that the blue line is moved to exactly match the top of the modal footer.\r\n\r\nI've got a little function that positions the blue bar to where the modal footer position is read. When `shown.bs.modal` is triggered, this is not the final position of the modal, hence the need for a timeout to shift it to the correct position.\r\n\r\nExpected result: The blue bar should be shown exactly at the top of the footer when the CSS transition is completed. It appears that `shown.bs.modal` is triggering too early.\r\n\r\nI should note that in #5045 it was noted that the `fade` class is needed for this to work. The modal the HTML I've used has that class and this problem is still present.\r\n\r\nTested with Bootstrap 4.1.0, 4.1.1 and  4.1.3.\r\n",

We've seen this be a consistent problem across different web browsers. I was using a previous version of Chrome (sorry didn't write it down) but upgraded to the latest before this, version 83.0.4103.61, interestingly enough, I see the same issue but slightly different.\r\n\r\nThe overall issue is I have a page using bootstrap, card-columns and youtube videos via iframes and some videos are not appearing as they should. You can see in the image below, I have 3 columns of cards using the card-columns class and originally, any video that was in the leftmost column worked, but any video in the middle and right columns didn't. After upgrading chrome to the latest version, it's the opposite, videos in the middle and right column work while any in the left column don't. They flash black when you first load the page and then blank out. You can never see the video, but if you hover over where the play button should be and click it, you can hear the video but never see it. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1134\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-01 at 12 57 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18473899/83438737-8f0de400-a407-11ea-8975-b9642316784c.png\">\r\n\r\nWe work in a djangocms project, where this was originally seen, I took the html and put in a blank page so we could try to narrow down the issue. We took everything out except the cards & bootstrap and the issue remains, leading us to believe it is a purely bootstrap issue. Some more details, we believe that the video itself is being pushed far to the right, if you inspect the page & select a singe video and slowly increase its width upwards of 100%, you will start to see it, from the right of the card and then move further left as you increase the width. \r\n\r\nThis is a problem i've spent several days on and have made very little progress. I believe it lies somewhere in bootstrap and card-columns specifically. I don't believe it is with any video since they were originally put on the page via a djangocms plugin, hence all similar, and since we copy and pasted them, moved them around, and the issue always persisted. If we took a working video and put it in a different column, it would run into this issue, but if we took a broken video and put it in a working column, it would work. Also, if we copy & pasted the entire card and/or iframe anywhere outside of card-columns it would work. I've attached the html page I slapped together to ensure it was just the bootstrap. This is my first time posting to the bootstrap repo but I should've followed all the guidelines, let me know if anyone has questions or need any further info, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[test.html.zip](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/files/4712771/test.html.zip)\r\n",

Depending on display settings and the browsers zoom level, this padding is sometimes applied, even when the page body is not scrollable and there is no scrollbar to begin with.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can tell this happens, when the value `right = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().right` rounds up, i.e. if `right - Math.floor(right) > 0.5`. You can check it yourself on [this](https://bootstrap-scrollbar-handling.stackblitz.io) demo site ([full Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/bootstrap-scrollbar-handling)).\r\n\r\nNote that in order for the value to be non-integer, the page must be rendered in a non-native resolution. This can be done by zooming in or out of the page, or by scaling the display in system settings like [these](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-custom-display-scaling-setting-windows-10) in Windows.\r\n\r\n### Tested browsers:\r\n\r\nI tested and reproduced this bug on **Windows 10** with the following browsers:\r\n\r\n* Firefox 70.0.1\r\n* Chrome 78.0.3904.97\r\n* Edge 44.18362.449.0\r\n* Internet Explorer 11.476.18362.0\r\n\r\n### Related issues:\r\n\r\nAs #28101 this issue regards the padding introduced to compensate for scrollbars. While in that issue padding is applied when the scrollbar cannot be hidden, this issue is about padding that is applied when no scrollbar was shown to begin with.\r\n\r\nI originally posted this at https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/3448, but now realised that the same issue occurs in the plain Bootstrap implementation as well (and for the same reason).\r\n\r\n### Suggested fix\r\n\r\nSome rounding must be applied in the method [_checkScrollbar](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/src/modal.js#L450) to accomodate for non-integer values:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  _checkScrollbar() {\r\n    const rect = document.body.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n    this._isBodyOverflowing = Math.round(rect.left + rect.right) < window.innerWidth\r\n    this._scrollbarWidth = this._getScrollbarWidth()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for the scenarios I tested. Still, I don't understand why `rect.left` is added here, so maybe I'm missing something...",

Apologies if I should have posted in the closed issue.\r\n\r\nI've been hitting a problem in Bootstrap 4 (wasn't able to reproduce the issue in Bootstrap 3) whereby I position an element over a Bootstrap modal when it opens (a date picker for my use case, but it applies to any overlay). I use `shown.bs.modal` to know when the modal is visible and the transition is complete - the [docs say](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/#events)\r\n\r\n> show.bs.modal | This event fires immediately when the\u00a0show\u00a0instance method is called. If caused by a click, the clicked element is available as the\u00a0relatedTarget\u00a0property of the event.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've been finding that the `shown` event triggers before the CSS transition is completed. The [test case](http://jsfiddle.net/fouavchs/1/) demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"Launch demo modal\" button in the output view (I've just used the docs demo HTML for the modal)\r\n2. Observe that the blue line is just above the model footer initially.\r\n3. After a second observe that the blue line is moved to exactly match the top of the modal footer.\r\n\r\nI've got a little function that positions the blue bar to where the modal footer position is read. When `shown.bs.modal` is triggered, this is not the final position of the modal, hence the need for a timeout to shift it to the correct position.\r\n\r\nExpected result: The blue bar should be shown exactly at the top of the footer when the CSS transition is completed. It appears that `shown.bs.modal` is triggering too early.\r\n\r\nI should note that in #5045 it was noted that the `fade` class is needed for this to work. The modal the HTML I've used has that class and this problem is still present.\r\n\r\nTested with Bootstrap 4.1.0, 4.1.1 and  4.1.3.\r\n",

This was also occurring in beta 2.\r\n\r\nWhen a Popover is activated on hover by an element on the top left of the page, it is initially placed at top=0, left=0 and so the mouse is over the Popover, not the hover trigger so the Popover is hidden, which triggers the hover event again and this loop repeats very quickly causing the Popover to flash on the screen (still in the wrong position).\r\n\r\nThis can be recreated with a very simple demo:\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n\t<button id=\"popoverButton\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Popover</button>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function() {\r\n\t$(\"#popoverButton\").popover({\r\n\t\ttrigger: \"hover\",\r\n\t\ttitle: \"Title of the popover\",\r\n\t\tcontent: \"Enough content to make the Popover appear over the trigger.\"\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n( CodePen here: https://codepen.io/ansarya/pen/dJmdMm )\r\n\r\nI haven't found any mention of this on the internet or in the issues or in the BS4 documentation.

It works correctly on every other device that I've tried, including iOS 8. I think the DOM doesn't update the <div>'s scroll height, so it doesn't think the modal should be scrollable. The `handleUpdate` function doesn't fix the issue, either.\n\nI've created a minimal example on Codepen at http://codepen.io/jkrehm/full/LpRzJV/ (code available [here](http://codepen.io/jkrehm/pen/LpRzJV)).\n\nThe most relevant code is this:\n\n```\n// Show loader & then get content when modal is shown\n$modal.on('show.bs.modal', function(e) {\n    $(this).find('.modal-body')\n        .html('loading...')\n        .load('https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=meat-and-filler&paras=10', function() {\n            // Use Bootstrap's built-in function to fix scrolling (to no avail)\n            $modal.modal('handleUpdate');\n        });\n});\n```\n\nIf I change the code so the content is loaded _before_ the modal is shown, things work fine, but there's no loading indicator for the user (just a pause of indeterminate length after they click the button and before the modal appears).\n\nWhat can we do to convince iOS 9 to recalculate the `.modal-body`'s scroll height? I've tried a number of things, and the only \"work around\" that works reliably is to hide `.modal-body` and show it again.\n\nI've also created a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32762539/dynamically-loaded-bootstrap-modal-does-not-scroll-on-ios-9) in case someone else runs into the issue and figures out a fix.\n",

And radios are not grouped with fieldset tag - but I found on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form#The_%3Cfieldset%3E_and_%3Clegend%3E_elements) and [H71: Providing a description for groups of form controls using fieldset and legend elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H71.html) that radios should be wrapped in fieldset tag. \nWhy fieldset tag is used instead of div's, which IMO is incorrect (of course I am not 100% expert :) I only place here my thougths) or am I wrong about it and it should be as is in docs now?\n",

The browser will believe any of the HTML elements in the modal are at a very different location than what is actually rendered, and this can be verified by examining the page using the Web Inspector.\n\nCheckout this [JSBin example](http://jsbin.com/zizaba/3) on an iOS device (preferably within the iPad Simulator with Web Inspector) and tab to the dropdown at the bottom, select an item, then try to select one of the text inputs within the modal.  You'll see that in order to select an input, you'll have to click/touch where the browser _thinks_ the `<input>` element is, not where it actually appears on screen.  To make matters worse, after removing focus from the `<select>` element, you won't be able to scroll the modal up or down at all until you select another input element within the modal.\n\nHere is a screenshot demonstrating how Safari believes the modal-content div is positioned higher (and where it responds to mouse/touch events) as opposed to where is actually rendered:\n\n![modal-dropdown-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/648386/7872179/1b66b942-0564-11e5-8194-1245b9648c72.png)\n\nI've come up with a hack to fix the `position: fixed` alignment bugs by adding a listener to any `select` element's `blur` event that realigns the content by forcing the HTML body to scroll to the top of the page with the following code:\n\n```\n$('modal').find('select').blur(function(){\n    $('body').scrollTop(0);\n});\n```\n\nBut this hack does not fix the modals scrolling even after the alignment is fixed.

        "body": "In Bootstrap v3.3.1 many of the font settings were properly reset for tooltip/popover content via https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/2862c30320e8a1c0499f4bd83141e0c6cd959f1e. I'm glad the decision was made in this direction, to reset font/text back to defaults within the content \u2014 but the implementation was incomplete. For example, we noticed already that a popover within `font-style: italic` text has its contents still italic. So https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/15046 does not seem fully resolved yet.\n\nIn case it's helpful, here's a LESS snippet (including a link that could lead you to a [relevant reference](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-pseudo-4/#first-line-styling)) that I used for resetting fonts in a non-Bootstrap project:\n\n```\n.reset-text(@fontsize) {    // used to avoid unwanted inheritance of text-related styles from a parent\n    // most of this list is based on properties first-line applies to [NOTE: hasn't been exhaustively reviewed]\n    // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-line (and W3C spec) for more details\n    font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal;\n    font-size: @fontsize;\n    // font, font-family omitted\n    color: black;\n    word-spacing: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none;\n    text-shadow: none;\n\n    // some other properties added in as well\n    text-indent: 0;\n    text-align: left; text-align: start;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the snippet above is not exhaustive (it likely covers only the properties we used/anticipated in this particular app and/or predates more properties being added to the spec) but hopefully a more thorough start \u2014 not to mention perhaps the idea to encapsulate all the reset in a reusable LESS mixin is valuable.\n",

In the same fashion, if the button is removed while the tooltip is showing then the tooltip will stick around again.\n\nI've created a [simple jsBin](http://jsbin.com/pudojataxo/1/) to showcase both scenarios:\n1.

The third button will disable/enable the first two buttons, so you can click that to re-enable the first and will then be able to remove the tooltip.\n2. The second button has a tooltip, and clicking it will remove all the buttons on screen. Doing so will leave the tooltip hanging around and there will be no way to remove it. If you had already disabled the first button by clicking on it, you'll now have two tooltips that will stick around until you refresh.\n\nThe bug does not present itself in Chrome (v39), but does in Firefox (v35).\n",

All 3.3.0+ can reproduce this problem. However, I found that if I mix the css from 3.2.0 with any version of `bootstrap.js`, it will not flicker.\n- I tested Firefox 34 and IE 11, both seem freed from this problem.\n- In the gist I styled `position: absolute` on the containing div, though the position/float seems have nothing to do with the flickering.\n- I tried replacing Flash object as image, and it seems no flickering.\n",

I could reproduce when changing the src after a modal is shown and the body of the modal contains the iframe element.\n\n**Reproducing**\n\nI couldn't manage to make it work in a JSfiddle and it seems the problem requires that the files are served through a server, so I prepared the steps to reproduce the issue (file contents below):\n1. Install node-static to start a basic server\n\n``` shell\n$ npm install -g node-static\n```\n1. Run the following command in the directory where lies the files `test.html` and `inner.html`\n\n``` shell\n$ static -p 8000\n```\n1. Access `http://localhost:8000/test.html`\n2. Position the scroll in the top (it will be default the first time you access, of course)\n3. Click in the first button\n\nWhat happens? The top window (the one containing the iframe) will scroll down when the iframe window jumps to the hashbang target.\n\nIt strongly feels like a browser issue, since it only happens on Windows 7 x64 in \"Chrome 39.0.2171.95 m\" (and \"Safari 5.1.7 (7534.57.2)\"), but I choose to report here because it may be related to the way bootstrap modals are built.\n\nDoesn't happen on Windows 7 x64 in Firefox 34.0, IE 11.0.9600.17501 and Opera 12.16 build 1860.\n### Files\n\nThey are all self contained, put them in the same directory (or use the plunkr below).\n\n**test.html**\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"modal fade\">\n      <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\n          <div class=\"modal-header\">\n            <button class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">&times;</button>\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\">Modal</h4>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"modal-body\">\n            <iframe></iframe>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n    $( \".modal\" ).modal({\n        show: false\n      })\n      .on( \"shown.bs.modal\", function() {\n        $( \".modal\" ).find( \"iframe\" )[ 0 ].src = \"inner.html#target\";\n      });\n      window.preview = function() {\n        $( \".modal\" ).modal( \"show\" );\n      };\n    </script>\n\n    <textarea rows=\"20\"></textarea>\n    <div>\n      <button onclick=\"preview()\">\n        Click and window will scroll down\n      </button>\n    </div>\n\n    <textarea rows=\"20\"></textarea>\n    <div>\n      <button onclick=\"preview()\">\n        Click and window will scroll down\n      </button>\n    </div>\n\n    <textarea rows=\"20\"></textarea>\n    <div>\n      <button onclick=\"preview()\">\n        Click and window will scroll down\n      </button>\n    </div>\n\n    <textarea rows=\"20\"></textarea>\n    <div>\n      <buttononclick=\"preview()\">\n        Click and window will scroll down\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**inner.html**\n\n``` html\n<div style=\"padding-top: 5000px\">\n  <p id=\"target\">\n    This scrolling is a problem *devil*  -->\n  </p>\n</div>\n```\n\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/ph2j5xkCYNMbXGx3o1Nf?p=preview\n",

I did this accidentally, not trying to troll my own application. The issue was previously resolved via #2941 and works well in 2.3.2, but was re-broken in 3.0 because the `.in` class is not added until the transition completes (as opposed to 2.3.2 where it's added immediately). You can observe the behavior on [Bootstrap's document site](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse). Expand the third pane then click panes 2 & 1 quickly. Panes 1 & 2 will open.\n\nThe straight-forward fix is pretty simple, I think. Instead of only checking for the `.in` class for \"actives\", check for `.in` and `.collapsing`, e.g.\n\n``` javascript\nvar actives = this.$parent && this.$parent.find('> .panel > .in, > .panel > .collapsing')\n```\n\nHowever, if that's the only change made, the \"show\" event is still triggered for the element, even though it's not going to continue to the end. So anything listening for the \"show\" event (e.g. something to toggle an icon or background color) will fire erroneously. Commit 13cad5061d46573c55def0e7a43cab1631317262 made the event trigger before both this check and the `isDefaultPrevented` check, so I'm guessing the author had a reason, but I don't know what it is, so don't want to submit a pull request.\n\nI'm using Chrome 38 on Mac OS Yosemite to test this.

When I say crash, I mean that an error message is displayed 'IE has stopped working' and the process is killed.\n\nIt might come from something specific to these pages but I don't manage to find what exactly. But removing these CSS rules (.label:empty and .badges:empty) from bootstrap prevents IE from crashing.\n\nI'm coming to you in the hope that you have ever heard about bugs like this one, and maybe you could give some advices.\n\nOtherwise, it could mean that :empty selector is dangerous with IE9 and that Bootstrap should not use it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nGuillaume D.\n",

When using IE9 and presumably below, any input text field element with the form-control class will have an issue when entering more text then what can fit in the width of the input text field element. \n\nThis appears to be due to the padding applied to the input text field element. IE10 and above along with Chrome and Firefox seem to handle the padding correctly but not IE9 and presumably below. \n\nWhen the string of characters entered by the user reaches the right inner limit of the input text field element (not including padding, boarder, or margin), any new character entered will be rendered behind the padding of the input element until it reaches the right inner limit plus the 12px right padding applied by the .form-control class. \n\nIf the user keeps entering more characters and the space of the characters passes the right padding limit. It will push all text over to the left as it should have done when it reached the right inner limit before the padding. It will repeat this issue again for every 1 to 3 characters entered thereafter depending on the width of the characters in relation to the 12px padding.\n\nSee attached images below. Text string used was \"hello world foo bar abcdef\" on the CSS page for forms-inline elements using IE9 version 9.0.8112.16421 - http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-inline.\n\n![wet-boew_ie9_input-fields_horizontal-scroll-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2136510/4094429/0e07ac8a-2fa8-11e4-91f8-7620ea98716d.png)\n",

I am using the latest version of Bootstrap from this repo to render a group of checkbox buttons very much like in the [demo](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons).\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"btn-group\" data-toggle=\"buttons\">\n  <label class=\"btn btn-primary active\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Option 1 (pre-checked)\n  </label>\n  <label class=\"btn btn-primary\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"> Option 2\n  </label>\n  <label class=\"btn btn-primary\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"> Option 3\n  </label>\n</div>\n```\n\nI've noticed a constantly reproducing issue. When I click on the checkbox button the actual input's `checked` DOM property _sometimes_ is not being set correctly. That is I click on the button, the label changes it's state, BUT the firebug says that the input's DOM property was not changed. And firebug doe not lie, because when I submit the form the input value is incorrect.\n\nThe issue can be easily reproduced [here](http://jsbin.com/sabipice/3/edit). Just trigger all the checkboxed from the first line (1,2,3,4,5,6) and then look their's 'checked' DOM property. One or two of them will have incorrect values. \n\nI've looked the source code and the problem is in this function\n\n``` javascript\n  Button.prototype.toggle = function () {\n    var changed = true\n    var $parent = this.$element.closest('[data-toggle=\"buttons\"]')\n\n    if ($parent.length) {\n      var $input = this.$element.find('input')\n      if ($input.prop('type') == 'radio') {\n        if ($input.prop('checked') && this.$element.hasClass('active')) changed = false\n        else $parent.find('.active').removeClass('active')\n      }\n      if (changed) $input.prop('checked', !this.$element.hasClass('active')).trigger('change')\n    }\n\n    if (changed) this.$element.toggleClass('active')\n  }\n```\n\nThe \n\n``` javascript\nif (changed) $input.prop('checked', !this.$element.hasClass('active')).trigger('change')\n```\n\nline does not set the property for some reason. A very strange thing is that when I try to `console.log($input.prop('checked'))`  after this line, it logs a _correct_ value.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n",

At the time of writing the commit is SHA: 4c2626fecb60f7f31f248ac10597294f2cd2471b\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Open this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lddubeau/6yz7r/embedded/result/\n2. Perform any of these:\n   \n   a. In the \"Independent\" section, move quickly onto a button and click it.\n   \n   b. In the \"Mutual\" section, move quickly onto a button and click it.\n\n**NOTE:** You must click the button before the tooltip appears. The delay is set to 1 second in the fiddle.\n### What is expected to happen?\n\nThe buttons should disappear without causing an unhandled exception.\n### What happens instead?\n\nAn unhandled exception happens. On Chrome the message is:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'tagName' of undefined bootstrap.js:1349\n   Tooltip.getPosition bootstrap.js:1349\n   Tooltip.show bootstrap.js:1215\n   (anonymous function) bootstrap.js:1159\n```\n### Observations\n\nThe problem does not occur if:\n1. The trigger is not \"delay\".\n2. Auto placement is not used.\n\nThe unhandled exception happens because the element for which the tooltip is created is no longer in the DOM. When `this.getPosition($parent)` is called, there is no parent element and an exception occurs in `getPosition`.\n\nOnly the tests in the \"Independent\" and \"Mutual\" sections show the problem. The \"Ancestors\" section shows that if an _ancestor_ of the element for which the tooltip is created is removed from the DOM instead of the element itself, then the `show` method will go through without error.\n\nDestroying the tooltip before removing the element for which it is created would prevent the problem. However, cases where GUI changes are triggered by automated processes (not under the control of the user) make catching the removal of such elements difficult in the general case.\n\nChecking whether `$parent` is an actual element, and bailing out of `show` if it is not, is the cleaner solution.\n",

Shrinking the viewport back to the narrow size still shows the un-collapsed navbar contents.\n\n(Btw, this is currently visible in the docs.)\n#### Why this happens\n\nWe're using the collapse plugin to do this. Right now it has no idea about the dimensions of your viewport. All it does is toggle the appropriate classes based on clicks\u2014click to open, click to hide.\n\nOur CSS utilizes those changes in classes from the plugin to style the menu accordingly. The CSS has no way to remove the `.in` class that the JS adds.\n#### Fix\n\nWe need the JS plugin to be updated to detect the viewport changes and remove the class. I don't know when or how this could happen, but that's the only solution. Will need to hear from @fat or anyone else with more JS-fu.\n",

What would be the best approach? Should we / is it possible to change the style of the Pills and Pagination to something which looks like OS X's segmented controls instead of iOS 7's?\n",

But adding a deep JQuery dependency for transitions kind of seems like a backwards move.\n\nUnless I'm missing a clever set of CSS rules that fix this issue, Bootstrap is going to have to drop _back_ to putting the scrollbar on the modal-body once IE9 support is dropped (well into the future I realize) and all animations move to CSS.\n\nSo is there something I'm missing that fixes this without a javascript dependency, and if not, is Bootstrap effectively not going to support CSS transitions without a JQuery dependency?\n",

I tried to get the fiddle to get the latest from github but jsfiddle complained. Visual inspection of the files on the wip branch tells me the issue has not disappeared since 3.0.0 RC2 .)\n\nThe following scenarios refer to the fiddle above. \n### Scenario 1\n\nIf you load the fiddle and click on the panel headers and don't touch the two buttons at the bottom, when expanding one panel, the other collapses. This is the expected behavior.\n### Scenario 2\n\nHowever, if you load the fiddle and then click the \"Trigger it programmatically\" button. Panel B will expand without panel A collapsing. The expected behavior would be for panel A to collapse as panel B expands.\n### Scenario 3\n\nIf you load the fiddle and then click the \"Workaround\" button, panel B will expand and panel A collapse. That's the expected behavior.\n### Scenario 4\n\nLoad the fiddle. Click on \"Panel B\". Works fine. Then click on \"Panel A\" so that panel A is expanded and panel B collapsed. Then, hit \"Trigger it programmatically\". It works as expected: panel A collapses, panel B expands.\n### Discussion\n\nWhat happens in Scenario 2 is that when the `$.collapse()` function is called, the element appears to be some random collapsible element not part of a group of panels that should be coordinated together. There is no information on the element itself to tell `$.collapse()` that there is a `data-parent` associated with this element.\n\nThis is confirmed by scenario 4. There, the click on the \"Panel B\" heading triggers `click.bs.collapse.data-api`, which causes the collapsible element to acquire a `Collapse` object which is properly initialized. From that point on, it is possible to call `$.collapse()` on that element and get proper behavior but that's only because the user first clicked on the heading.\n\nThis is also confirmed by the workaround which consists in duplicating the information already present in the HTML so that the `Collapse` object is created properly. There is another workaround in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lddubeau/6uzL6/ This fiddle contains a modified HTML where the `data-parent` attribute is set on both the toggles and on their targets.\n\nIf the `data-parent` attribute were specified on the element that actually collapses rather than on the toggle (and modify `click.bs.collapse.data-api` to seek the `data-parent` information from its target) it would avoid having to duplicate the information either in the JS or in the HTML.\n",

Here's a snippet of those class definitions from `responsive-utilities.less`:\n\n```\n// Tablets & small desktops only\n@media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) {\n  .visible-sm {\n    .responsive-invisibility();\n  }\n  .visible-md {\n    .responsive-visibility();\n  }\n  .visible-lg {\n    .responsive-invisibility();\n  }\n  ...\n```\n\nIf a fix for this \"broken\" behavior is desirable, it would be as simple as reformatting the above styles as such:\n\n```\n.visible-sm {\n  .responsive-visibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n}\n.visible-md {\n  .responsive-invisibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n}\n.visible-lg {\n  .responsive-invisibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n}\n.hidden-sm {\n  .responsive-invisibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n}\n.hidden-md {\n  .responsive-visibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n}\n.hidden-lg {\n  .responsive-visibility();\n  @media (min-width: @screen-tablet) and (max-width: @screen-tablet-max) { .responsive-visibility(); }\n  @media (min-width: @screen-desktop) { .responsive-invisibility(); }\n}\n```\n\nI've created some test jsFiddles:\n- [Current Bootstrap](http://jsfiddle.net/zacwasielewski/maWXz/) (\"broken\")\n- [Modified Bootstrap](http://jsfiddle.net/zacwasielewski/GyWyL/) (fixed)\n\n(And here's [the diff of my branch](https://github.com/zacwasielewski/bootstrap/compare/responsive-visibility-utilities-as-less-mixins) of the Bootstrap rep.)\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n",

Like viewing a web page that was not setup for Responsive Design at all. It turns out this is a Bug on the phone and Microsoft is aware of this and working to fix this problem. Now we all know how long it will take for the phone carriers to release updates like this. So I was testing this on the older versions of Bootstrap and even looked at the new Bootstrap 3 site with my phone and still see the problem. I simply added the following JavaScript code in the head and now it works right on my phone.\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--\n(function() {\n    if (\"-ms-user-select\" in document.documentElement.style && navigator.userAgent.match(/IEMobile\\/10\\.0/)) {\n        var msViewportStyle = document.createElement(\"style\");\n        msViewportStyle.appendChild(\n            document.createTextNode(\"@-ms-viewport{width:auto!important}\")\n        );\n        document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(msViewportStyle);\n    }\n})(); \n//-->\n</script> \n```\n\nThanks to the articles and research at the following link I was able to fix this.

Likewise, the `.make-column()` mixin works the same way.  If the gutter width was a parameter to the mixins, I could (for example) make a custom condensed grid like so:\n\n```\n@condensed-gutter-width: 8px;\n.row-condensed {\n    .make-row(@condensed-gutter-width);\n    .col-lg-1 {\n        .make-column(1,@condensed-gutter-width);\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n...then when I wanted to use the condensed grid, I could just use `row-condensed` instead of `row` in my CSS.\n\nThis would be even easier with an extra mixin such as `.make-columns(@gutter-width)` to batch out all the columns at once.\n",

There are also some decisions about the theme that might be useful to get feedback on.\n\nTo reiterate why this isn't the default styling for BS v3, let me quote @mdo in a recent issue:\n\n> The intention is to enable easier overrides and customization for folks who treat Bootstrap as a first-step, not an end solution.\n\nThe choice was based on pragmatic considerations, not flat-vs-skeuomorphic design ideology (as some seem to have misinterpreted the decision). It's simply that fancy gradients make things harder to further customize heavily compared to plain solid colors.\n\nCaveats:\n- Just getting \"plain\" v3.0.0 fully polished and out the door is going to take a lot of effort, so it's possible/likely that this theme might not get made until some time after the release of v3.0.0-final.\n- These plans are not finalized. @mdo could change his mind.\n",

Open up webdeveloper tools (I use Google Chrome), go to Console tab and execute: `$(\"#collapse .accordion-body:last\").collapse(\"show\");`\n3. Result: The last accordion opens, but the first isn't closed.\n\nThe problem (briefly):\nThe third accordion doesn't have `parent` option set, because we didn't provide it.\n\nThe workaround solution:\nStart the third accordion with parent option set, and after that try to `show()` it. Note, that `hide()` and `toggle()` also triggers this bug.\n\nThe proper solution:\nCollapse constructor should look for `parent` setting (and all other too) in `data-` attributes of the `$()` element, as a fallback. If user doesn't provide these options, he obviously wants the Collapse to read those from `data-` attributes.\n\nThe cry story:\nWasted a couple of hours, why the accordion didn't work after `show()`. It's super counter intuitive, that the `options` aren't read from `data-` attributes, when you start the Collapse manual way. I suppose all other plugins inherit the same behaviour (starting by `data-` attributes reads `options` from these attributes, where starting manual way don't).\n\nKind regards\n\n-------- Edit\n\nIt's funny when you notice your own mistake only after you cry about it.\n\nOf course `accordion-body` doesn't have `data-` attributes to read from, so the `The proper solution` isn't quite working. But the problem remains. How do we mix the auto `data-` usage with the manual usage. I.e. how to achieve such a workflow:\n1. Start the accordion/collapse through `data-` attributes.\n2. `open()`, `hide()`, `toggle()`, `whatever()` the accordion manually (occasionally) later on.\n\n?\n\n-------- Edit\n\nOk, it was quite easy: `$(\"#collapse .accordion-body:last\").collapse({parent: \"#accordion2\"}, \"show\");`. But, can you see the notobviousleness of this solution? If I wanna `show()` an accordion, I don't wanna think to which `parent` it belongs, since I've already provided the information in the `accordion-toggle`. I just want the damn thing to show itself properly ;p. Also note the information duplication in this solution, which simply leads to maintenance hell in the future.\n",

Refer to the demo to see this in action.\r\n\r\nHowever, the example on that page does not show how to use the `data-bs-parent` attribute.\r\n\r\nThe [example from the v4 docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/collapse/#accordion-example) shows how to use the `data-parent` attribute to get accordion-like group management.\r\n\r\nThe `data-bs-parent` attribute works in v5, but I had to parse the docs for v4 in order to figure out how to use it.\r\n\r\nI'm doing accordion-like group management, but not wanting the accordion markup, so using collapse with the `data-bs-parent` attribute works perfectly for me.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a regression arising from moving the accordion to a separate section in the docs. Ideally, I think the v5 docs for the collapse component should have an example showing the use of the `data-bs-parent` attribute and the v5 docs for the accordion component should describe the `data-bs-parent` attribute as critical for accordion behavior.\r\n\r\nSee also #33214.",

        "body": "This likely is going to be a pain in the ass, but I wanted to capture some thoughts regardless of where we land on it. My hope is that we can put some time into our old v4.x docs and update them with new outdated release banners and links to the latest versions of each page in our versions pickers. I'd like help brainstorming our approach to this, because right now all I can think of is manually doing it one by one.\r\n\r\nTwo things are on my mind for it.\r\n\r\n## Updated new release banner\r\n\r\nFirst is updating the release banner, and adding it to all previous v4.x releases.\r\n\r\n![bootstrap-newer-version-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257860-59adcc80-17d4-11eb-9c38-4072d567c152.png)\r\n\r\nRight now there's a thin banner on the 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 docs. We don't have them on 4.3 or 4.4, and soon 4.5 (after we ship our next v4.6.0 release). At a minimum, we need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add banner 4.3\r\n- [ ] Add banner to 4.4\r\n\r\nAnd for the stretch goal, we take it 1-2 steps further:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change the links of each banner to be page-specific (as in, don't link to `https://getbootstrap.com` on every banner)\r\n- [ ] Redesign the banner to be larger and more noticeable\r\n\r\n## Updated versions dropdown\r\n\r\nBeyond the new version banners, I'd like us to do something more with our versions dropdowns in the navbar. Each version of our docs (4.0\u20134.5) is different, which leads to unfortunate experiences of viewing outdated docs and not being able to easily jump to the latest version of the page.\r\n\r\nQuestion is, do we include every version like so?\r\n\r\n- **4.0:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5\r\n- **4.1:** 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5\r\n- **4.2:** 4.3, 4.4, 4.5\r\n- **4.3:** 4.4, 4.5\r\n- **4.4:** 4.5\r\n- Bootstrap v5.x\r\n\r\nOr, do we do the version you're reading, the latest v4.x, and the latest v5.x like so?\r\n\r\n- 4.0: 4.5\r\n- 4.1: 4.5\r\n- 4.2: 4.5\r\n- 4.3: 4.5\r\n- 4.4: 4.5\r\n- Bootstrap v5.x\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, for all v4 and v5 versions dropdowns, do we include links to v3 and v2? Thinking we can drop those with these changes, and keep the `All versions` link.\r\n\r\n## v3?\r\n\r\nBeyond v4's docs, I'm wondering if we need to update v3.4's docs to modify the new release banner and versions dropdown. Thinking we modify the text in the banner to mention v4 and v5. With the dropdown, I'm thinking we remove the v4 alpha 6 release finally, update `Latest (4.x)` to `Bootstrap v4.x`, and add `Bootstrap v5.x`. Both the v4 and v5 could point to their latest releases instead of all the releases.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots of dropdowns\r\n\r\nJust for quick comparison...\r\n\r\n<img width=\"585\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 13 41 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257930-7fd36c80-17d4-11eb-8612-abed4cd179be.png\">\r\n<img width=\"619\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 13 53 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257931-806c0300-17d4-11eb-9c14-eac2c4f5cbed.png\">\r\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 14 01 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257933-81049980-17d4-11eb-85fc-ca701bca0025.png\">\r\n<img width=\"589\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 14 13 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257935-81049980-17d4-11eb-9d93-41279b9346f1.png\">\r\n<img width=\"579\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 13 08 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257923-7d711280-17d4-11eb-9eee-9b6f52db41c2.png\">\r\n<img width=\"622\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11 13 22 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/97257925-7ea23f80-17d4-11eb-89c4-c5810a94bb4a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @twbs/team?\r\n",

It might not be present in other browsers and it is hardly noticeable, however when you notice it you cannot ignore it.\r\n\r\nI've encountered this issue while making a website and then found out it is present also on [https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/](url)\r\n\r\nI would describe this issue as if for some reason the blur filter could not be applied to the first top part of the subnavbar (same issue with a standard navbar) as it is shown in this picture: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"643\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-24 at 20 46 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55589885/85622458-252fd580-b667-11ea-8094-e2a30dd8957f.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever the good news is that I could actually find a solution to this problem after hours of useless attempts by simply wrapping the nav item in a div element (which obviously also needs the class \"sticky-top\") with a custom style.\r\nSpecifically I created a \r\n```scss\r\n.bd-wrap-subnav{\r\n  background-color: rgba($white, .75);\r\n  backdrop-filter: blur(1rem);\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\nafter commenting both background-color and backdrop-filter present in the `.bd-subnavbar` in the _subnav.scss:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.bd-subnavbar {\r\n  // The position and z-index are needed for the dropdown to stay on top of the content\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  z-index: $zindex-sticky;\r\n  //background-color: rgba($white, .75);\r\n  //backdrop-filter: blur(1rem);\r\n  box-shadow: 0 .5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, .05), inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .15);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI modified the \"docs-subnavbar.html\" partial like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"sticky-top bd-wrap-subnav\" style=\"backdrop-filter: blur(1rem);\">\r\n<nav class=\"bd-subnavbar pt-2 pb-3 pb-md-2\" aria-label=\"Secondary navigation\">\r\n  <div class=\"container-xxl d-flex align-items-md-center flex-wrap\">\r\n    <form class=\"bd-search position-relative mb-2 mb-md-0 mr-auto\">\r\n      <input type=\"search\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"search-input\" placeholder=\"Search docs...\" aria-label=\"Search docs for...\" autocomplete=\"off\" data-docs-version=\"{{ .Site.Params.docs_version }}\">\r\n    </form>\r\n\r\n    {{ partial \"docs-versions\" . }}\r\n\r\n    <button class=\"btn bd-search-docs-toggle d-md-none p-0 ml-3 order-3 ml-auto\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#bd-docs-nav\" aria-controls=\"bd-docs-nav\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle docs navigation\">\r\n     {{ partial \"icons/menu.svg\" (dict \"width\" \"30\" \"height\" \"30\") }}\r\n   </button>\r\n  </div>\r\n</nav>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"822\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-24 at 21 52 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55589885/85623826-44c7fd80-b669-11ea-9bad-daa268df7263.png\">\r\n",

It says options can be passed in with data attributes and lists `toggle` as an option, but I can't have two `data-toggle` attributes, and `data-toggle` doesn't appear to take multiple arguments.\r\n\r\nThe documentation suggests this will work (reduced options for clarity):\r\n```html\r\n<button data-toggle=\"collapse false\" data-target=\"#collapseExample\">\r\n  No collapse toggle\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<button data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-toggle=\"false\" data-target=\"#collapseExample\">\r\n  No collapse toggle\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut neither do. The first doesn't trigger any collapse functionality and the second is invalid HTML.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\nI expect `data-toggle=\"collapse false\"` will trigger collapse one time in one direction, rather than toggle back and forth. It should function the same as `.collapse('show')` or `.collapse('hide')`, and show/hide depends on the target element.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion:\r\n- Update the documentation to explicitly state `data-toggle` won't work and can only be passed as an option with JavaScript\r\n- Update the plugin to take `data-toggle=\"collapse false\"` or `data-toggle-state=\"false\"` options\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n- Create an collapse element with `data-toggle=\"collapse false\"`\r\n- Collapse no longer works for that element\r\n",

I have attempted to follow the posted guidelines but if I have made an error please let me know so I may remedy that issue in the future.\r\n\r\n### The short version\r\nThere should be documentation outlining the fact that if a modal is created with the `.fade` class it is also required to have a `.modal-dialog` class.\r\n\r\n### What is occuring\r\n\r\nIf a modal is created with the `.fade` class and not the `.modal-dialog` class the modal will show but it's `_isTransitioning` property will never be reset.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/eb81c39f2c36d88d4ebc062a2fa179980827e8be/js/src/modal.js#L263-L271\r\n\r\nAs is shown here a listener for `transitionEnd` is attached to the child element of the modal with the class `.modal-dialog`. However, since `.modal-dialog` is `null` the listener is not attached and the `transitionComplete` method is never called. This results in a modal that cannot be hidden as it is considered to be transitioning at all times.\r\n\r\n### The issue\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to enforce the addition of the `.modal-dialog` class. A check could be implemented to skip the `transitionEnd` listener if the dialog element is `null` but that could lead to issues where users could re-trigger the modal before it has visually finished animating, which is what the entire `_isTransitioning` property seems to be preventing in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis information should be exposed in the documentation so developers looking to co-opt the javascript modal functionality without the styling are aware of this requirement.\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nRefactor the [Remove Animation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#remove-animation) section to be an **Animation** section that details the fact that `.modal-dialog` is required when using the `.fade` class because it is used to listen for a transition and then contains a second paragraph containing the existing remove animation content.",

Whilst the [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/ ) website **does have a dropdown in the top right** for the latest versions of each version of Bootstrap, this isn't always going to facilitate for older versions of Bootstrap, or versions which are being used in some themes these days (see [here as an example](https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/magento?compatible_with=Bootstrap&sort=price-asc)).\r\n\r\n**The current docs selector:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"312\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-15 at 16 05 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25177538/42735270-f073e0e6-8848-11e8-817a-5b0a295a5d94.png\">\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of themes out there which I've used in the past which use **Bootstrap v3.0.0**, and whilst this is older than 3.3.7, it's not always possibly to upgrade and we shouldn't be limited to not being able to access documentation for each of these.\r\n\r\n**A suggestion, and something to consider**, once **Bootstrap 4.2** is released I'm not sure whether another link in the dropdown for versions will be added, or whether the 4.1 link will be replaced, but either way, whatever option that is chosen could clutter and make it hard to find older versions if you're less technologically advanced.\r\n\r\nWhat you could do, is something very similar to what Bulma are doing, I think it's simple, straightforward and allows you to link to all of your versions, and allows us developers and designers to quickly find the **exact** version that we need, see the example below:\r\n\r\n**Example: https://versions.bulma.io/**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-15 at 16 04 32\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25177538/42735261-d00e41ac-8848-11e8-8d7a-586f0a0da49d.png\">\r\n\r\n**Maybe consider adding an 'All Versions' link to the current dropdown, e.g-**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"287\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-15 at 16 08 52\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25177538/42735303-648e617c-8849-11e8-9fbc-4c40b6a0e9f2.png\">\r\n",

We provide compiled CSS and JS (bootstrap.*), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (bootstrap.min.*).

For me, I figured it might be: Bootstrap, Popper and jQuery all together, but then found out it doesn't include jQuery.\r\n\r\n**Whilst it possibly might be a breaking change to change the file name, I think it should be made a little clearer on the getting started section, and actually, wouldn't take too long to implement other than a README.md update? or something similar.**",

        "body": "**Usecase:**\r\n\r\nI work at a large company and we want to use Bootstrap 4 in order to create a unified theme that we can share across our organisation. So that all teams use our customized Bootstrap instead of the official one. For sure we don't want to make any changes to bootstrap itself but only to variables. To give the teams all the freedom they need we don't want to offer compiled CSS and JS sources but rather deliver the raw sources (SCSS). \r\n\r\n**The Problem:**\r\nThe _custom.scss file is now gone and the official way seams to define all custom variables before the user  imports bootstrap. The default variables will then use the users value. So far so good. **But** to give users a better survey we'd love to produce our own docs. A compiled version of getbootstrap.com using our variables.\r\n\r\nWe could do this very quick and dirty by forking the bootstrap repository and adjusting the docs generation by adding a custom file or something like this. But this solution will cause problems. Especially when we think on **upstream changes** we want to include. So if we fork - we want only to do minimal changes in order to keep merge conflicts at a appropriate level and maybe Bootstrap should keep this user story in mind and even **offer a solution** to this situation.\r\n\r\nI did a ton of google searches - and believe me this is hard since the search results are polluted - and since I'm not going to be the last one I'm opening this issue to discuss the best way, maybe implement a generic solution that works at scale and to keep track of some resources. \r\n\r\nTheming docs:\r\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/\r\n\r\n**An example what was achieved regarding this issue for bootstrap 3:**\r\nhttp://styleguide.daimler.com/bootstraptheme/\r\n\r\n\r\nI think actually Bootstrap itself is currently running in this issue.

In other words, `:hover` styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element.\r\n\r\nThis is not completely correct. Currently, it seems that only iOS/Safari (and other iOS browsers using WebKit) has issues with sticky `:hover` under certain conditions. Seems limited to links, buttons. Here, `:hover` style remains applied, and other styles like `:focus` and `:active` are ignored. `:focus` does \"stick\" in all mobile browsers, even in iOS for controls like \"faked\" `<span ...>` based buttons or similar.\r\n\r\nThe prose itself, if we want to keep it, would need some rejigging, making it clear that `:hover` stickyness is an iOS/Safari only problem.\r\n\r\nThe workaround mentioned - relating to the `hover` mixin, is currently commented out and non-working. We should just remove mention of it (perhaps include some other advice, or just that we're not doing anything special here to prevent this sticking at this stage). And deprecate the mixin properly (@mdo mentioned \"`@include hover { }` just returns a normal `:hover`?\").\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25182\r\n\r\nHoping that for 4.1 we can experiment with using the upcoming `:focus-visible` https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focusring-pseudo pseudo-class with polyfill, to fix sticky `:focus` as a result of touch (and mouse). And that hopefully we can find an iOS/Safari specific hack or workaround to fix the sticky `:hover` that occurs in certain situations just on this platform.",

Autoprefixer is required because the scss files don't include the vendor prefixes, so we need postcss. But I did wonder why the \"precss\" plugin is also suggested. As I understand it precss allows some \"scss-like\" mixins, variables, etc with slightly different syntax. Surely this is already covered by sass-loader which compiles the provided scss files? And because sass-loader runs first, it has already compiled all those scss features. So precss => NOP?\r\n\r\nI tested with and without precss. The only difference in output appears to be that precss strips the :root { ... list of custom css variables ... } and formats the bulk of the css with multiple selectors per line. The official dist css files do have the custom css vars. They are not actually used anywhere, and would not work in IE11 anyway, but might be useful for reference from any custom js?\r\n\r\nSo: \"less is more\" ?\r\n\r\nSuggest removing \"precss\" plugin from this suggested webpack config. \r\n\r\n",

For inline help text and other flexible options, use utility classes like `.text-muted`.\r\n- Dropped `.radio-inline` and `.checkbox-inline`.\r\n- Horizontal forms overhauled:\r\n  - Dropped the `.form-horizontal` class requirement.\r\n  - `.form-group` no longer applies styles from the `.row` via mixin, so `.row` is now required for horizontal grid layouts (e.g., `<div class=\"form-group row\">`).\r\n  - Added new `.form-control-label` class to vertically center labels with `.form-control`s.\r\n  - Added new `.form-row` for compact form layouts with the grid classes (swap your `.row` for a `.form-row` and go).\r\n- Added custom forms support (for checkboxes, radios, selects, and file inputs).\r\n- Added HTML5 form validation support via CSS's `:invalid` and `:valid` pseudo-classes.\r\n**- Renamed `.has-error` to `.has-danger`.**\r\n- Renamed `.form-control-static` to `.form-control-plaintext`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was replaced by .is-invalid",

The documentation mentioning that the backdrop is enabled on touch support would have saved time.\r\nSimilar situation have happended in the past for others ([SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30925699/hide-bootstraps-dropdown-backdrop-css-only), [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35612895/links-and-ng-clicks-in-bootstrap-dropdown-not-working-on-chrome-48-for-windows-8)).\r\nOf course I will fix the z-order of the dropdown now. (I do not want to hide the backdrop, to support closing menu on real mobile devices.)\r\n\r\nbrowser: firefox 52.0.2\r\nos: windows 10, 64bit\r\n",

In hope to save others the time, I thought i'll share the final recipe -\r\n\r\nstart by installing bootstrap in your project -\r\n```\r\nnpm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6 --save\r\n```\r\n(notice bootstrap has two dependencies - jquery and tether. If you would rather have explicit versions of those two, you should install them as well)\r\n\r\nimport bootstrap's javascript through index.js -\r\n```javascript\r\nimport 'bootstrap';\r\n```\r\n(i'm assuming you're using es6, in case of es5, use `require('bootstrap')`)\r\n\r\nThe previous line will only import the js part of bootstrap. for the styling part you have two options -\r\n\r\n### 1. Precompiled SASS\r\nInside one of your sass files (index.scss for example) add this line -\r\n```SASS\r\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss\";\r\n```\r\n(notice the ~ (tilde) which points to the node modules folder)\r\nThis mehtod is beneficial if you plan on using your own version of the wonderful __variables_ file bootstrap comes with. just make sure you import __variables_ before _bootstrap_. Also, now you can use all the cool mixins bootstrap has.\r\n\r\n### 2. Compiled CSS only\r\nIf you're not planning on using the variables or the mixins, and prefer the precooked css file, simply add this line to index.js or any other js file -\r\n```javascript\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\r\n```\r\n(btw - you can also import this way the sass file, but it's nicer to import it via another sass file as shown in pervious mehtod)\r\n\r\nnow comes the webpack part. for _jquery_ and _tether_ to be available as a global variable throughout the project, you'll have to add this to your webpack plugins sections -\r\n```javascript\r\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({ // inject ES5 modules as global vars\r\n  $: 'jquery',\r\n  jQuery: 'jquery',\r\n  'window.jQuery': 'jquery',\r\n  Tether: 'tether'\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThe different jquery definition are meant to answer requirements of different libraries (for example angular looks for 'window.jQuery'). I'm assuming your webpack.config already has rules for scss and/or css.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! now you have bootstrap in your webpack project.\r\nLet me know if any further explanation is needed, and if anyone knows of a better way, please share.",

If you change the `.row` element to `<div class=\"row\">`, then the markup works fine with or without flexbox enabled.\n\nI haven't yet discovered why using `fieldset.row` with flexbox causes the grid to breakdown, but I will post here as soon as I determine the cause.\n- Operating system and version (Windows 10)\n- Browser and version (Chrome 52.0.2743.82 m)\n- JS Bin: http://jsbin.com/naqapizepa/edit?html,output\n",

I was thinking that it would be great if there's a easy and intuitive way to also bootstrap a configurable style guide on top of Bootstrap docs. That would allow to generate a static style guide based on and extending Bootstrap docs, and letting you also add your custom modules.\nFurther, it would be great for it to have Huxley (or similar) integration into a Grunt task, so that it also allows you to test your styles for unintentional changes.\nI see a good benefit for everyone to promote the use of style guides and visual testing, and have it easily generated, customized and built, and not to be seen as an unaffordable thing. Much like what Bootstrap is giving to everyone, the ability to have a pattern library from day 0 of your project, same to having a style guide and visual testing from day 0 if you want.\nI propose myself as the first contributor to that sub-project after learning a bit more about Bootstrap documentation.\nAny feedback on this?\n",

This is a normal workflow when a person is reading docs (or something else) and then wants to put let's say his/her browser window side by side with their code editor window. Right after resizing the window the media query fires and colons go on top of each other - the height of the entire document increases, whereas the scroll stays at the same position as it was before. That makes you lose the place where you were reading and sometimes it's very hard to find where you were before (the more responsiveness - the harder it is).\n\nThis can be solved by adding a class `scroll-preserve`; javascript will look for such elements and if they are inside current viewport it will after resize scroll to the same place as it was before resize.

The live demo is great, but it doesn't really help much because it's ScrollSpy that's doing a lot of that work, not just Affix. It might also help to state here exactly what ScrollSpy is doing and how Affix works with it.\n2. In the detailed description it says: \"You must provide the styles for these classes yourself (independent of this plugin) to handle the actual positions.\"  But then, a couple of lines later, it says \"Scrolling past the element you want affixed should trigger the actual affixing. This is where .affix replaces .affix-top and sets position: fixed; (provided by Bootstrap's CSS)\".\n\nIt took me a few minutes to understand those two statements, The first one seems to be saying that the developer has to add positioning, but then it says \"position: fixed\" is added by the class. Seemed contradictory at first. So as I understand it, Affix adds \"position: fixed\", but the developer needs to add the actual numeric offsets. Can you clarify this a little more, maybe specifying that the developer needs to supply the \"top\" values and whatnot?\n\nSorry if these are two different issues.

If we start building a Bootstrap theme using, let's say, `v3.3.0`, after the `v4.0.0` release we cannot use the script to test the theme anymore because markup won't match.\n\nThere's a simple way to provide downloadable compiled docs as zip for every single Bootstrap release: manually tagging references to historical states of the `gh-pages` branch according to Bootstrap's releases, with some nomenclature like `v3.3.0-docs`.\n\nTaking into account what @mdo said in #12915, this is a scalable solution due git's nature and Github's features; tags and branches behave kinda the same for these purposes.\n\nIf there's a more practical way to download compiled docs for a given Bootstrap release that I'm missing, please let me know and excuse me.\n\nRegards.\n",

It doesn't happen. \n\nHere is [an online test case](http://jsbin.com/fakupini/6/edit).\n- Click the button\n- Click the alert div\n- Expected: the alert div closes\n- Instead: the alert div doesn't close\n\nThe most relevant parts in the test case are\n\n```\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">Some alert message</div>\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n$('.alert').alert()\n```\n\nThe most relevant part in the Alert plugin's code is:\n\n```\nvar dismiss = '[data-dismiss=\"alert\"]'\nvar Alert = function (el) {\n  $(el).on('click', dismiss, this.close)\n}\n```\n\nIt is called by .alert(). So, we can see that the \"dismiss\" selector is passed to the \"on\" method. It means that the alert element will be closed on click only if it has a [data-dismiss=\"alert\"] attribute. But again, as far as I can understand, .alert() is supposed to be an alternative of that attribute. If no, the .alert() method without parameters appears to don't make any sense, because a developer is forced to set an attribute anyway. The dismiss functionality is already enabled for all alert elements with the attribute by this code in the Alert plugin:\n\n```\n$(document).on('click.bs.alert.data-api', dismiss, Alert.prototype.close)\n```\n\nAs a possible solution to fix the problem I would probably replace\n\n```\n$(el).on('click', dismiss, this.close)\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\n$(el).on('click', this.close)\n```\n\nThen the click handler will be attached regardless any selector.\n\nP.S.

To use, add `.has-warning,` `.has-error`, or `.has-success` to the parent element. Any `.control-label`, `.form-control`, and `.help-block` within that element will receive the validation styles.\n\nMainly at issue is adding the `has-*` contextual classes to the \"parent\" element. Parent to what? In the case of labels, it's the parent to the `.control-label` , as 15c7e5f makes clear.\n\nSo adding the following doesn't work (nor do I think it makes much sense):\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"checkbox has-error\">\n  <label>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"\">\n    Option one is this and that\u2014be sure to include why it's great\n  </label>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above case is a copy of the the docs for checkboxes, which don't have (or need) the `.control-label` class on the label.\n\nA solution would be to add the `.control-label` class to the `label`: \n\n``` html\n<div class=\"checkbox has-error\">\n  <label class=\"control-label\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"\">\n    Option one is this and that\u2014be sure to include why it's great\n  </label>\n</div>\n```\n\nBut what is more likely the desired behavior is to target a group of inputs, where a div with the contextual class wraps the entire group of inputs:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"has-warning\">\n  <label class=\"checkbox-inline\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"inlineCheckbox1\" value=\"option1\"> 1\n  </label>\n  <label class=\"checkbox-inline\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"inlineCheckbox2\" value=\"option2\"> 2\n  </label>\n  <label class=\"checkbox-inline\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"inlineCheckbox3\" value=\"option3\"> 3\n  </label>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis is a long post to start a (hopefully) brief discussion about which way to document this, if at all.\n",

        "body": "In the [Carousel documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel), there is the following Usage example:\n## Usage\n### Multiple carousels\n\nCarousels require the use of an **id** on the outermost container, **.carousel**, for carousel controls to function properly. When adding multiple carousels, or when changing a carousel's id, be sure to update the relevant controls.\n\n---\n#### Proposed Fix\n\nThe places where it says **id** should be replaced with **class** or the **.carousel** should be an id selector instead.\n\n---\n\nThere is also the following example that shows an active class on the first and only carousel item, \n## Examples\n\n``` html\n<!-- Wrapper for slides -->\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n    <div class=\"item active\">\n      <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\">\n      <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n        ...\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ...\n  </div>\n```\n\nThe problem with this is that if you duplicate the `div.item` element with the `active` class, having `active` on multiple items will break the carousel and prevent it from moving left or right.\n\n---\n#### Proposed Fix\n\nChange the example to \n\n``` html\n<!-- Wrapper for slides -->\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n    <div class=\"item active\"> <!-- First visible carousel item -->\n      <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\">\n      <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n        ...\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item\">\n      <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\">\n      <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n        ...\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ...\n  </div>\n```\n",

La gu\u00eda de migraci\u00f3n ahora especifica que estos se convirtieron en \".input-sm\" e \".input-lg\" respectivamente; sin embargo esto no es del todo correcto, porque al hacer ese cambio estar\u00edamos modificando el alto del input, lo cual no era la intenci\u00f3n al usar la clase de Bootstrap 2. Si bien es cierto que en la documentaci\u00f3n de Bootstrap 2 hab\u00eda una aclaraci\u00f3n al respecto, seria considerado hacer una aclaraci\u00f3n similar en la gu\u00eda de migraci\u00f3n, para ayudar a los desarrolladores que deben hacer migraciones masivas.\n- \".modal hide fade\" se convirti\u00f3 en \"modal fade\", pero no esta especificado en la gui\u00e1 de migraci\u00f3n (no es relevante, pero debo comentarlo)\n- En http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default, hay un ejemplo que esta utilizando \".container-fluid\", pero esta clase fue removida.\n- Los input type=\"date\" no se visualizan bien en una pantalla peque\u00f1a cuando est\u00e1n encerrados en un \".input-group\" y con un \".input-group-addon\". Esto me suced\u00eda con la v3.0.3, no sabr\u00eda decirles si sucede lo mismo con la v3.1.0 (aunque creo si).\n\nBueno, este es mi reporte.

        "body": "Hello, I think I found 2 minor changes for your your IE8 + responsive design documentation:\n\n1) While researching IE8 + responsive design + Bootstrap, I found StackOverflow posts where people didn't know IE can change it's \"Document Mode\" which may break responsive design in IE. (This is the way to tell IE8, for example, to render the page as IE7 or \"IE8 Compatibility Mode\". Also because Document Mode can be set by the user, the webpage, or the server, it's not always obvious if IE is rendering the page with the version you think.)\n\nI would suggest adding something like the following to \nhttp://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers\n\"If you are experiencing problems with IE, \n1) Make sure your page declares its doctype by using the tag <!DOCTYPE html> before your <html> tag.\n2) Try including the following tag in `<head>`: `<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />`.\n\nThis will make sure IE is not rendering the page as an older version of IE. (You can   check the Document Mode IE is using to render the page by opening IE's debugging tools; press F12 and look what is being used for the \"Document Mode\".)\n\n2) Secondly, on http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template I would suggest moving the\n\n```\n< !--[if lt IE 9]>\n      < script src=\"https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.3.0/respond.min.js\"></script>\n<![endif]-->\n```\n\nout of the head and to right before `</body>`\n\nNormally, it works fine in the `<head>`, but if you start making your own custom CSS media query styling, IE8 won't apply the correct styling until you resize the browser.\n\n(BTW, don't touch the `<script src=\"https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/html5shiv/3.7.0/html5shiv.js\"></script>` tag. It works best in the`<head>` where you have it.)\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have questions or need clarification.\n\nBootstrap is awesome. Thank you,\nMatt\n",

What would be the best approach? Should we / is it possible to change the style of the Pills and Pagination to something which looks like OS X's segmented controls instead of iOS 7's?\n",

Purchasing the set for each project is certainly not out of the question, however I would like to see the license terms explicitly stated prior to having to add a line item for icon purchase to invoices.\n\nAccording to the [Glyphicons license page](http://glyphicons.com/glyphicons-licenses/) , Halflings isn't included in the Glyphicons FREE set but [it's suggested on the Bootstrap site](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons) that a special agreement has been made between Twitter and Glyphicons to include Halflings with Bootstrap:\n\n> Glyphicons has granted us use of the Halflings set in our open-source toolkit so long as we provide a link and credit here in the docs. Please consider doing the same in your projects.\n\nI am not a lawyer, but the phrase _\"has granted **us** use of the Halflings set\"_ suggests to me (and my colleagues) that only the Bootstrap project has been granted a special license and that users of the toolkit would be subject to Glyphicons' normal license. Someone recently proposed a question of the Halflings set's license to Glyphicons on Twitter and [the response](https://twitter.com/status/217161495069458432) was ambiguous but seemed to suggest that _any_ attribution was acceptable when using Glyphicons with the Bootstrap toolkit:\n\n> If it's not possible to include a link back to [glyphicons.com](glyphicons.com), it would be right to have any license, but it's up to you.\n\nPlease update the Bootstrap website and/or the LICENSE file distributed with the source to expicitly state the license terms for the Glyphicons Halflings set when used with Bootstrap, whatever those terms may be. This will help those of us striving for compliance to determine whether to use Glyphicons or an alternative icon set with less intrusive license terms (such as [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)).\n",

What points to `'.dropdown-toggle`'?  \n**_Markup**_: There is no description about how the `<a>` tag is related to the dropdown menu it enables. How they relate? Is the `data-toggle` an optional way to enable dropdowns? Is it required? \nThe markup example shows that the `<a>` tag _\"target a specific dropdown by using\"_ `href=\"#menu1\"`, but that `#menu1` is the same `<li>` everything is contained in... Not very clear.\n### Toggable Tabs\n\n**edited**  \nThe description starts with **Markup** section, where it displays an `<ul>` list and how to code it to properly to be displayed as a Tab/Pill list.\nHowever every list item shows an `A` with href attributes with  `#selector` like values, but there's no description about about them.\n\nDescription continues with **Methods** section, where it explains that $().tab() activates a given tab element.\nBut now the markup example displays a totally different markup example where:\n- Now there is an example of the content tab. Shouldn't be this in the **Markup** example too? \n- Also, the explanation about how we must relate each tab with what content is here instead in the **Markup** section.\n### Collapse\n\n**Using it**: It says that to start using it just use `$('.collapse').collapse()`, but don't specify what '.collapse' points to (is it the content to be collapsed or the element that toggles the collapsable content?)\n### Carousel\n\nI haven`t used this yet, but seeing its docs I see that lacks same basic info mentioned in previous components\n\nBasically I find documentation is taking for granted that user knows some very basic stuff about how to build markup for each component, what data-attributes are required or optional, and what must point the selector passed to js function.\n",
